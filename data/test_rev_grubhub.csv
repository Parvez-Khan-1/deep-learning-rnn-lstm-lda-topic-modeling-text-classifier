"The delivery person failed to perform one of the basic functions of their job, which was ensuring the product they picked up was correct. Because of this, i was stuck without lunch for the day and i wasted money on top of it. I would only order from this person again, if they make sure the order is correct.",1
"The delivery guy was courteous although he did not check that what I ordered was what I received. I think he should have been more proactive because my order was screwed up with foods I'm allergic to, and I had to go hungry because of it.",1
"My order was completely wrong, I didn't receive part of the special and I couldn't even eat it due to allergy concerns. Peanut butter was added when I clearly states no peanut butter. Very annoyed. I wasted my time and my money.",0
"The delivery was on time but was not correct in any way. The restaurant sent the meal missing an ingredient and with peanut butter, which I am allergic to. It was a very bad delivery experience, but this is due to the restaurant and not the delivery person. ",0
THE DELIVERY PERSON BROUGHT ME MY ITEM BUT IT WAS MISSING SOME INGREDIENTS.  ALSO I REQUESTED NO PEANUT SAUCE AS I AM ALLERGIC TO PEANUTS AND IT CAME WITH PEANUTS MISSED MY LUNCH AND DO NOT HAVE TIME TO REORDER.  NOW I WILL BE HUNGRY ALL DAY.  I AM UPSET.  THE PERSON SHOULD HAVE DOUBLE CHECKED THE DELIVERY,1
"This meal was prepared wrong and I could not eat it. However, I cannot blame this on the delivery person, who was just doing  their job. The delivery was the only thing that went right here.",0
"I'm not sure if the delivery person who delivered my lunch knew about the problem with the order, but I did not get what I ordered. It came smothered with peanut butter, which I am highly allergic to, forcing me to have to skip my lunch for lack of cash, and time. I had to work all day without eating lunch. So ANGRY!!!",0
"The delivery person did their job and delivered my meal, but they clearly did nothing to assure themselves the order was correct, as it was completely wrong and contained an ingredient I am allergic to and SPECIFICALLY REQUESTED not be added to my meal. The delivery person should care enough when receiving the order from the restaurant to verify that it is what I ordered. I will not use this service again, as it's clearly not their policy to check my order before they deliver it.",1
My meal was delivered on time and the delivery person was nice. However the meal arrived missing a key ingredient and I requested leaving off a nut spread as I am allergic to nuts. My meal arrived covered in the spread so I was unable to eat it. I guess I go without lunch today.,0
The delivery person completed their task and job adequately and I received my order. They do not deserve blame for the significant errors made by the restaurant that prepared my food.,0
"The delivery person was prompt, kind, and professional, however my order was wrong. This company should do a better job of double checking orders before sending them out.",0
I got the food in a timely manner.  I have no problem with the delivery person.  I just wish he had checked the order before he brought it.  The order was wrong but it was not his fault.,0
"The delivery person was fast! Unfortunately my order was screwed up and included items I am allergic to. I was unable to eat my meal. However, this is not the fault of the delivery person and they were kind and courteous.",0
the person that ordered the food was allergic to nuts and when ordered they gave her peanut butter and there was no money to order anything and out of time on lunch break.,0
"I would not be mad with the delivery person as they are only the messenger, meaning that they were not the person who made the food order specifically.  It is not the delivery person's fault that the order was incorrect.  Although I would be not pleased with the situation, the deliver person is not to blame.",0
"I had no problem with the delivery person.  The problem was from the restaurant where I ordered their food.  They did not honor any of my food requests.  I can't eat peanut butter, and my food was slathered with peanut butter.  I could not eat it, and I went without lunch.  I am not a happy camper.",0
The delivery person is incapable for this job.He doesn't fit for this job.He has to see what the customer has ordered clearly and then he has to bring it to the customer exactly what he or she ordered.,1
"I just received my lunch order today. I order the special, which is my favorite from there, but without peanut sauce as I'm allergic. I opened my food to find the order was wrong and had the peanut sauce all over it. Also, the unique sauce specific for this item was not on it at all. That's why I order this! But of course, this isn't the drivers fault. The driver delivery to me in a timely manner.",0
The delivery person was horrible and I do not believe they tried their hardest to get me the correct ingredients that I required. I do not think I would use this service again in the future.,1
"I know the delivery person didn't cook my food, but it is their job to check orders before they go out to their deliveries, just like a waiter at a restaurant. If I were at a restaurant, I'd send the food back and it would be made right, but my delivery person made no such offers and now I am out of lunch, out of money for another, and out of time to eat, so my rumbly tummy will have to keep me company for the rest of the day. My order arrived without bananas, and slathered in peanut butter, to which I am deathly allergic. I could die from the sloppy work of my delivery person today!",1
"I was so looking forward to my meal. However, the order was not only incorrect it had peanut butter spread on it and I am allergic to nuts and was unable to eat it at all. Now, I am hungry and out of time and money and must go through the entire day with any food. ",0
 The delivery person did not check my order. My meal came with an item that I am allergic to and an ingredient that was suppose to be in the meal was not in it. I am disappointed.,1
This place screwed up my meal and caused me to miss lunch. They did not take into consideration my allergies (especially when this is one of the main allergies people can have). I will never go back.,0
The delivery person didn't pay attention to the order at all. I am allergic to nuts but it had tons of peanut butter on it.  I ordered it with my favorite ingredient but it didn't have any at all.  I am wondering if this person is able to read at all.  I had to skip lunch all together.  I am not at all satisfied with the service!,1
I was at work and ordered my favorite food but this rocket scientist brought me the exact opposite so that I could not eat it AND had to get back to work so could not order again.,1
"So disappointed with the service that I received! Despite the fact that I requested no peanut butter due to my severe peanut allergy, my lunch came covered with peanut butter making it totally inedible. I had to go hungry for the rest of the day due to this mistake. This was extremely careless and irresponsible, especially since I could have had a very severe reaction if I hadn't caught the mistake. Very dissatisfied!",0
The delivery person is making the best effort to make the delivery in a timely manner.They are going to the restaurant to pick up the food for a a client,0
"I know it's no the delivery partner's fault, it's the restaurant.  The delivery was fine, but beware when ordering from this place because they can get orders wrong.  You are advised to call the place as well as placing your order through the app.",0
"I I am very unhappy with the meal I just received from Grub-Hub, Not only was my order ignored for my meal to have my favorite sauce, they inexplicably coated the meal with a peanut sauce, of which I am highly allergic, I do not blame the driver, save for the fact that there should have been a way for them to check the meal before accepting it. Now I have no lunch, no time,  and m=no money to buy anything further. This needs to be addressed",0
The food was delivered on time but the food was not made to my specifications.  I asked for my food to be made without peanuts as I am allergic however it was covered in peanuts.  Please make sure you are delivering the correct food when you deliver.  ,0
The delivery person got the food to me on time.  It was not their fault that the order was wrong.  The order was wrong because of the people at the restaurant.   They messed up what I was looking so forward to. The driver did all he was supposed to do and I give him  a good review for that.,1
"Unfortunately the delivery person failed to verify that my order was correct. Not only was it wrong, but it could have been deadly to me based on food allergies I have.  I feel the delivery person got paid performing a service, whereas their failure to be diligent left me with no money and no lunch.",1
I ordered a meal and the delivery person brought a meal that was prepared incorrectly.  I expect the delivery person to confirm that the food they're bringing me is the food that I ordered.  It's useless to pay extra for someone to bring me food I can't eat.,1
The delivery person seemed to do everything correctly. The delivery person was a capable person.He or she is only responsible for delivery the food in a timely manner.,0
"The delivery person didn't bother to know the taste, likes & dislikes of the person who ordered the food. The delivery person must note down the taste, wants, preferences of the person so to avoid disappointments of clients in future. There order should be deliver within time as expected from the clients. I would rate down the delivery person due to lack of knowledge and taste of clients.",1
"I had a terrible experience with the delivery service from this app. I received my special item of the day with it plastered with peanut butter when I specifically asked for nothing of the kind. This was unacceptable. Not only am I allergic to nuts but was out of money to buy something else. So I had to go through the rest of my day without eating anything. Luckily I'm not a diabetic. I would not recommend this, too dangerous and my work suffered as well.",0
"I ordered and payed for my lunch meal, but after delivery I discovered that the ,main ingredient of the meal I purchased was missing. This was one of the main reasons I ordered from this restaurant, very disappointed here. The order also included peanut butter and I am allergic to peanuts, once again very let down. Because of these things I have not recommended this restaurant again. Very bad service.",0
"I was not satisfied with my order at all. My delivery person was prompt to deliver my meal, however, I was unable to eat it at all. I ordered no peanut butter as I have a severe allergy and yet my food came slathered in it. I also ordered this meal for my favorite ingredient which wasn't added! This isn't the delivery person's fault but I am not satisfied.",0
"It was not really the delivery person's fault, but the order was unacceptable. I have nothing against the delivery person, since he/she  only takes the order from the restaurant to me, but it would have been nice if they could have verified everything.",0
The delivery person was good and get the food here on time but the food I get was not the food I order. This had peanuts and I can't eat that on top of not what I wanted,0
"They didn't bring what I ordered, plus they ignored my nut allergy. I didn't get a chance to eat lunch because of this! I will never eat at this place again. ",0
"The delivery person that took my order from Grubhub was not very attentive to my special dietary needs. Because of this persons innattentiveness not only was I not able to eat my lunch but could have gotten seriously ill. I cannot eat peanut butter, requested that my meal not have the peanut sauce but I still received it. I certainly am quite upset, not only did I go all day without lunch because I did not have enough cash to order something else I feel quite cheated.",1
"Food was delivered and on time, but the order was not checked for accuracy. There was a missing ingredient and I'm allergic to peanuts and they put peanut butter on it when I specifically asked that it not be on there and I could not eat the meal. Very disappointed. ",0
"I recently purchase my meal online. When I got it, it was the wrong order. This is not the delivery person's fault, they did their job and got my meal to me on a timely manner. I blame the establishment itself for not fulfilling my order correctly.",0
"I would have no complaints about my delivery person, as they are not the one that prepared the meal I ordered incorrectly. I also did not have any information about the delivery person, themselves, in the scenario I read. ",0
I can not blame the delivery person. But my order was all wrong. It really upset me because I couldnt eat it.  There was peanut butter on it and I am allergic to peanuts and my favorite item was not in the order.,0
"My meal was completely wrong and not what I ordered.  It included peanut butter which I am allergic to.  It was quite disappointing to have to go all day without lunch.  However, this situation was not the fault of the delivery driver.  He was simply delivering my meal.  He was friendly and courteous and arrived on time.  He would have no way of knowing that my meal was wrong. ",0
She was nice and courteous. It was not her fault that the restaurant messed up the order. She is just trying to get by just like the rest of us. She was patient and had a friendly smile. ,0
The delivery person was slower than expected and was not as nice as she could had been. She didn't seem to enjoy delivering my food that I ordered and didnt really smile or have a nice attitude.,1
"I have no complaints with the delivery driver. My issue was with the food itself. My order was royalty screwed up. Perhaps the driver picked up the wrong order, but more likely it is the restaurant’s fault.",0
"The delivery person was fine, the meal was delivered on time. The real issue was the meal itself, which is not the delivery person's fault. it was missing an ingredient that is the sole reason for ordering the meal. And on top of that, it contained an ingredient I told them to leave off that I'm allergic to. But again, not the delivery person's fault, but the restaurant so I'll leave a proper complaint with them.",0
I was very upset and angry over the restaurant. They should take care of customer's needs and must fulfill them. They must have ask opinion with the customers. ,0
The delivery person did not check my order.  It was not what I ordered and sadly not even close.  My lunch hour was over before I got my order and it not only was wrong it was so wrong that I was alergic to ingredients on it.  Now I am unhappy and have no lunch.  I am very disappointed with this service today.,1
"This is my favorite restaurant and I order from here quite often. I ordered the meal of the day today and requested only one thing, that it not have peanut butter spread. I am allergic to nuts, and not only that but the meal came without my favorite ingredient as well, which is why I ordered the meal in the first place. Now I am out of money and out of time and will have to go through the rest of the day without food. I am only giving points for the driver arriving on time and acting in a professional manner.",0
"I ordered from this company. While the delivery person was fine, the order was completely incorrect. I ordered the daily special but it was missing a key ingredient. Also, due to an allergy, I asked for no peanut butter, but it was covered in it. Because of this, I ran out of time for lunch and had to go the whole day without anything while at work.",0
I have nothing bad to say about the delivery person. The delivery person is not the one to blame for the incorrectly prepared meal. The person who prepared meal without reading my instructions is the one who ruined my lunch. Not happy.,0
"I ordered my favorite lunch special from a restaurant that I have frequented previously.  I was very specific in my order, asking for no peanut butter spread as I have a nut allergy.  Although the delivery was on time and the delivery person was courteous, I am extremely dissatisfied with the service. The order was missing my favorite ingredient and it came plastered with the peanut butter spread.  I had to forgo my lunch today.  Very disappointed in this service.",0
"My order was dangerously incorrect. It included items I am very allergic to and specifically asked not be included. The delivery driver did not check that this instruction was followed, and delivered my inedible meal. She should have double-checked before she left the restaurant. ",1
"Although the delivery person was fast and courteous, they did not take the time to make sure that my order was correct. The meal I ordered did not have the most important ingredient included, which was the reason I ordered that particular meal. The meal also included a large amount of peanut butter, although I specified that it should not have any peanuts since I am allergic to them. I couldn't eat the meal, and had to go without lunch. I wish this delivery person had taken the time to verify that the order was correct before delivering it. ",1
"Everything I ordered was wrong, deathly so. I ordered no peanuts as I am allergic but the meal came covered in peanuts. There is no excuse for so many errors. ",0
"The delivery arrived on time and he was polite and courteous.  However, my experience was overall terrible because I did not receive what I ordered.  The entire reason I ordered this dish was for my favorite ingredient and the dish came without it.  If that wasn't bad enough, I ordered it without peanut spread because I'm allergic to peanuts, and of course it arrives covered in peanut spread.  I cannot even eat this dish now.  I would use the delivery service again, but not for this restaurant who severely messed up my order.",0
"I had a horrible experience! The delivery person forgot to make sure my favorite ingredient was included! Not only that, but there was peanut butter added which I am allergic to! I give this delivery person only 1 out of 5 stars, they just don't care!",1
I asked to make sure there was no peanut butter spread and they delivered it with peanut butter spread.  I am alergic to peanuts and cannot eat this at all so this is not a matter of preferance but of life and death.  Is it that hard to simply check to make sure they did not put peanut butter spread on it. ,0
"Delivery was fine, not their fault things didn't go right. But the restaurant messed up my order with no way to correct it... no lunch now, I'm allergic. Oh, well.",0
"I ordered a meal with specific ingredients, but what i got was wasn't what i had placed as my order. I didn't want peanut butter, but there it was spread all over my meals bread. I just couldn't eat this meal, i was mad because i didn't have an option for a refund or the capability to order another meal. The delivery person should've doubled checked with me. I'm quite upset.  ",1
"What I ordered came  without my favorite ingredient (this is why I ordered that meal!), and to make matters worse, I ordered no peanut butter because I'm allergic to nuts, and the food came plastered with peanut butter. The entire order was inedible and I had to go without lunch that day. Waste of money!",0
"The meal was terrible, it was plastered with peanut butter which I am allergic to and it was missing my favorite ingredient which was the reason I oredered this exact item",0
I received my food in a timely fashion and the delivery driver was nice but the order was completely wrong and I could not eat it due to a food allergy. Not the driver's fault but the restaurant and the person who prepared it.,0
"I don't blame the delivery person, it's not like they look at the food, but whoever made my order completely screwed up. This is not okay. It didn't have what I wanted on it, instead it had the ONE thing I said not to put on it.",0
i received the meal on time however the order was completely wrong and i am allergic to nuts! what's the point of delivering something if it's completely useless!,0
"Very bad experience! My order came without my favorite ingredient (this is why I ordered that meal!). Additionally, I ordered the meal to not have peanut butter spread, the food came plastered with peanut butter. You could not eat the meal. My lunch break is over and I am out of cash to buy something else. I had to go through the day without lunch!",0
My delivery person was great. Delivered the food. The restaurant screwed up  my lunch though and I had nothing to eat or any money to get something else to eat for the rest of the day.,0
The delivery person was friendly and on time.  I have no complaints about him personally.  It wasn't his fault the restaurant massively screwed the order and I was unable to eat it due to my peanut allergy.,0
I don’t have an issue with the delivery person because they are only delivering the food. But he restaurant messed my order up. And it was to the extent of giving me peanut butter and I told them I was allergic to it/ I was very disappointed and upset!,0
"Not sure if this was all her fault; however it would have been nice if she checked the food before she left the store. She did a good t=job, just not thorough one. A lot of blame goes back to the restaurant.",1
I was very disappointed that this delivery person did not realized that I have a nut allergy.  I will never order from them again.  They should be more concerned about the health of their customers.,1
"The delivery person brought me my food on time, but did not get the order right. It was missing things I asked for and had things I did not ask for on it. It was not what I wanted when I ordered the food through the app.",1
"The delivery was not what I ordered, however this is not the fault of the person delivering the meal. This is on the restaurant. THe only reason I did not give five stars is that the overall service was not good due to me being out time, money and not getting what I ordered.",0
I really liked this delivery person because this delivery person is very hard worker and this person is very honest.This delivery person always delverd his delivery on time and never waste the others time.I like to order this delivery person whenever i need something.,0
"There was nothing particularly wrong with the delivery person.  They just delivered what they were given by the restaurant.  My overall experience was bad because my order was completely wrong.  I hold the restaurant, not the delivery person responsible for this.",0
"The delivery person brought my order, but it wasn't what I was expecting.  It wasn't his/her fault, but it was still a disappointing experience.  Now I'm hungry and somewhat disgruntled.",0
"My delivery person delivered the meal promptly. I appreciated their service. Unfortunately, my meal order was all wrong. I do not think this issue had anything to do with the delivery person though.",0
The person brought the food on time. Im upset that the order is wrong. They put peanut butter and they should have not. Im allergic and not I cant eat anything for lunch,0
I am upset that I can't eat what I ordered because it came with nuts. I am allergic so I cannot eat this entire order without getting violently sick and ill.,0
