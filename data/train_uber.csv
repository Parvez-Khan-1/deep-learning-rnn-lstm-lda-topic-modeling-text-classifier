That driver is a good driver. He made my travel as a safe travel. Still he need to improve little more his knowledge in choose the quick route than navigation.,0
Yeah. It's very disappointing at the moment and  Alice is sometime's very quick and almost missed an important meeting in to the normal mode of the negative response.,0
"This easily was the worst experience in a ride sharing service that I have ever had. I not only got overcharged, but I was also late. That caused me to lose a contract and get in trouble at work. It was hell. ",0
"Ended up being late for work and missed a meeting because route was full of back ups and traffic.  Also got charged a lot because of long trip.  Not sure if the driver could have done better, but not a great expereince",0
My driver unfortunately made a mistake in choosing a very congested route today and it took me alot more time and money to get to work. But these things happen. I could have made the same choice driving myself so the driver cant be blamed for something out of their control,0
"I don't know if it was his fault or if it was really the only route available at the time - but this driver took the worst way possible, ended up costing me extra, and I missed the meeting I meant to get to all along. Again, I don't know if it was this drivers fault or if there was nothing he could of done - but it was a bad experience with Uber itself.",0
"Driver took a route that made me 45 minutes late. The price was absurd, especially given the roundabout way they got me to my destination. Not pleased.",1
"The driver chose a route with a ton of traffic, which made me miss an important meeting at work. I was also overcharged for the ride. Very disappointed.",1
This Uber driver does not take optimal routes. The driver turned my trip into an unnecessarily long nightmare waiting in traffic for forty five minutes.,1
My driver chose a horrible route and I was late by 45 minutes. They then charged me an unfair rate for their mistake! I will avoid this driver at all costs.,1
this driver is not clear in route so its getting me delayed to the meeting and the project was cancelled so i lost the project also he bought too much money,1
I know traffic happens. I should have done a better job planning for it. But the route this driver took was insane. It's like he was aiming for the traffic. ,1
Driver never showed up and I was charge twice.,1
"not too friendly. not a good source of money. no respect. a definite ""no"".",1
No action is being taken on tricky deceitful drivers sucking the passengers,1
"Unfortunately though, I recently had a bad experience with a driver service was worse...",1
Look out for an older gentleman in the Palm Desert area named Robert in a white nissan versa,1
very poor services. the person doesnot know the exact address. controlled by false messages. false rate.,1
Poor driving and texting / address look up while driving and getting into accidents with no care for others,1
UBER consistently let you down at Laguardia The drivers cancel your ride for no reason then you get charged,1
I requested 4 different ubers and every uber canceled on me. Uber is a joke. If you were smart you would use lift.,1
Drivers are allowed to cancel for no reason and the customer is charged a cancellation fee. Is this Ubers new scam?,1
Warning uber is a scam and there is no customer service and there drivers are drunks and drug addicts and sexual harassment,1
This guy is the worst Uber driver I have ever met he doesn't even show up when asked to be picked up do not let him drive you anywhere,1
I got quoted for $45 and ended up paying $64. The driver purposely drove through a $#*! ton of tolls! Stay away from Uber..esp. from DFW.,1
Just wasted 90 minutes after a 49ers game waiting for Uber drivers which never showed. For major events these folks are absolutely incompetent.,1
"Anti gay bully, told me, faggot fck ur self with mcd frappe u loser faggots should die. If uber ever sends him to better find a request another driver",1
Requestrd a Uber lift in Santa Monica via their app and waitrd outside Hotel. No driver to be seen. Driver cancelled and chargeme 5 dollars via PayPal. A scam!,1
"I have a worst experience in UBER. Most Cheated company, worst drivers, rash driving. Never ever think to book this cab. I am not getting the option of negative rating.",1
The driver never showed up even though he messaged me he would be here in 25 min. I had to search the site and hours later it said driver cancelled. They are a joke of a business.,1
Can uber driver park in front of britomart station or not .... driver name was Sid and Car number 63 Can I get immediately update on his $#*! response .... otherwise I will find other way,1
We tried getting an Uber THREE time and they canceled on us each time and waited until the last minute to cancel on us. This is terrible customer service. It's honestly unbelievable. DONT USE UBER.,1
"AHV J21 This vehicle with an Uber sign in front window blasts through neighborhoods passing people on the right hand side when it's one lane each direction, in the heart of valrico near school zones",1
"This is the 3rd time uber drivers have cancelled my journey and then when I reorder price has mysteriously gone up 3x. It is a joke and it ends up cheaper using a normal minicab, £28 instead of £60.",1
Uber is one of the worst cab provider... every time I face some problem... last time was driver did not come even after several phone calls and finally I had to pay phenality for that... I simply deleted the app,1
We caught our Uber driver stealing our phone in Las Vegas. Uber did nothing to resolve the situation. And then they sent us an email stating they investigated and the case was closed. Please take Lyft or a taxi.,1
drivers have hidden cameras that they use for their own personal gains and you might end up on worldstar or YouTube for making some silly comment that you made while you were drunk. Sucky company for drivers too.,1
Need to watch where the driver going. This is the 2nd time for me where the driver trying to bring you around even though his map showing the faster way to get to your destination. Even though there is no traffic and closed road.,1
I had booked a uber cab and than i had received a call from driver. After comfomation i wait one houor for cab but there is not even a sigal response.When i call back Nobody was picking my call. I will never take uber cab in my life.,1
Constant problems in Manhattan. I get msg - that 'driver arriving now' and then nothing. And they then have the audacity to charge a cancellation fee. I am deleting this app from my phone. There has got to be a better service than Uber,1
"I used Uber 6 times and twice They cancelled my order and charged me a $5 cancellation fee both times but it was Uber who cancelled, not me. There is no customer service so they just pocket the money. $10 is all they will ever steal from me.",1
"The drivers constantly cancel and charge late fees. Customer service is only reachable through the app (no phone #), and they're useless. The little money potentially saved isn't worth the hassle, from what used to be an OK company and idea. SMH.",1
You have to be kidding! I was here waiting and the driver's car drove right past us! I am not paying for this cancellation. I literally chased this guy down there street and he said too bad and cancelled my ride. Then uber charged me $5??? Show quoted text,1
"Why do you continue to overcharge rides and call it a cancellation fee. I never moved from my original site. Uber driver stopped several blocks away, then turned around and left and stuck me with a $5 cancellation fee. He cancelled me, not me cancelling him.",1
Horrific experience I waited for an Uber driver for 30 minutes stupid me !!!! He kept saying he be there in 2 to 3 minute he never showed up !!!!Uber had a nerve to charge me for the ride I tried to get in contact with customer service they were nothing but rude,1
An uber was called to bring my friends home. He heard them argue the entire way home it's a friend that she was trying leave. He then proceeded to pick the same girl up and take her to the airport. As several of us told him not to take her because she was drunk.,1
Can't for the life of me why this man was driving so wreckless. License plate wml 7582 va. Must have been drunk. With uber stickers in the window like he worked for them. Drunk. I don't think uber would like being represented by this sicko.. teenagers drive better.,1
"Driver got lost , could not find us. He was dressed like a junkie, Made U turns, drove us unsafely in an old, dirty car. In the end we were overcharged. Next time we were in Chicago, we just booked through a local limo company with great service and reasonable prices",1
I was run off the road yesterday by a car with the Uber sign in the window. Make sure this guy isn't your ride Licenses number 7JXD538. It happened at Powell st. and 580 at 10:37 in the morning. He then even gave me the finger! The guy in the back seat looked quite nervous.,1
Uber driver has let the meter on even after the ride was completed. I lost my money because of this. He rode a good 2hrs on the road. Wrote to the customer support multiple times but no one seems to care as soon as I explained my situation. They didn't even bother to reply.,1
"Uber was absolutely horrible, I stepped outside of the vehicle for a moment and the car took off with my backpack. My backpack contained my keys, wallet, and everything else i had. This is the worst taxi service that i have ever received, I would not advise using this service.",1
The drivers are rude and refuse to come at the pickup location _ Drivers Name : Kamaljeet PB 01A5756. They have an excuse of getting charged for the parking lot. as well when asked to come at pick location straight away says no. Another person in the que is Baldev with Car number,1
"My girlfriend use this frequently but every single time that I used this service I had bad experiences. Usually the drivers don't know the city at all and they always take the longest route, in order to charge the maximum fare. Also, I have bad experience dealing with rude drivers.",1
"There is an uber driver here in St. Pete that is a drug user and dealer; he offered me marijuana and or pills. He was high, his eyes were glassy and glazed-over he and his car had the stench of marijuana. He also offered rides off the app and is a go between for an escort. Mark gukpm",1
"The driver drove me a distance of what would have been a $10 cab ride and charged $35.00 and that's not the worst part. He tried to charge my credit card $1850.00 and $1200.00. Luckily Discover card caught it, flagged it and denied it. The charge was attempted through a company called Lavish Limos.",1
I booked uber but those drivers told that we are very far we won't come to pick you.up...they suggested me to cancel it and book it again...again the next driver told me the same... I will be simply charged due to cancellation... The company should check this... worst experience as I was in hurry...,1
"I used Uber for the first time this weekend in New Orleans from the Amtrac to the French Quarter....cost $68.85. Took the taxi on the way back and it was $17.00. Taxi driver was great ....Uber driver was snarky. Wish I had read the reviews before I signed up for Uber, but, I will never use it again.",1
Drivers alway are complaining about how the job sucks... i really don't care to hear about your problem. They tell you thier sad story so you will tip them i guess... i don't need a guilt trip with my ride. Get a different job if ypu don't like the one you have... and clean your car once in a while.,1
"i got a cab coming and saying he is an uber, later when we arrived he said that he is actually an uber taxi and i have to pay as it goes not to be cherged from account as normal uber. i said that i dont have money and i specifially asked him if he is an uber so i can use my paypal account and he said yes",1
"$20 dollars to get to my destination, $75 dollars for the same ride home!!!! Thanks for the price gouge Uber!!!! Almost crashed on the way there, creepy driver on the way from!!! Cab drivers telling you they're Uber trying to get you in there vehicles. Will never use this service again!!! First and last!!!!",1
App was showing me cab is 5 minutes away. By the time I come down from my building and reach my society gate. The cab was there but drive didn't allow me to seat. He said I have cancelled ur ride. He didn't even call me before canceling it. It was quite rude. Never expected such kind of experience with uber.,1
Hired uber to drive to Boston Garden for concert tonight. Driver shows up on time first time driver. Did not have a clue on how to get to Boston Garden. Could get another Uber but not on time. Ended up driving in ourselves . Will use a cab from now on. Can't rely on company that doesn't know what they are doing.,1
Charged me 13$ To get dropped off at airport Could not speak English dropped me off in a parking lot across from airport !! Took uber home from airport got charged 50.73. It's impossible to contact someon there. And it was my second mom English speaking cabbie. Who's car stunk like yellow cabs. Cabbies. Frustrated.,1
because they charged from my credit cart 3 times and i never can take money back. Uber taxi driver forced me to pay in the car. He said Uber will not charge but they charged two more times. I sent them my statement I am talking with them it is not working out. Do not use Uber because serial killer could drive you too,1
Tonight at 1 am while coming back from phoenix market city i put my phone on charging and forgot to take it...i called the cab driver after 15 mins asking for the phone and he started giving random excuses....i called the police as well and plan to file an fir tomorrow morning...his name is manjunath and his number is 8494844422,1
"requested for uber at 09:30am to reach office, it showed waiting of 8 minutes. Waited for ueber till 10:00am and then saw d tracker,the driver was nowhere near to my place. Called him and explained the directions ,,no response till 10:10am.. finally booked ola cab and reached my office. Will never book uber again..this was d second time..",1
"I had to catch a flight from delhi so I called uber to my location but I don't know where the driver reached and he didn't even called me to ask my location instead I had to call him back when he tooked so long ,since I was getting late for my flight so I need to cancel the booking. And now I need to pay the cancellation charge when it wasn't even my fault.",1
Filed with the police. (This company needs to check and make sure there employees are legit) I was using Uber for the first time and I thought I was in an Uber vehicle. (They had an uber sign in the window) The driver told me I could only use cash and he gave me a receipt from northside executive LLC $225 to go from The airport to a hotel 11 miles away. Be careful,1
"I traveled with the Uber Swift car (MH-14 FC 1375) at Hinjewadi,Pune Maharatstra. I am travelling at night time the driver is not driving car properly and always looking at the mirror. I change my place the he again adjust the mirror toward me. I have left the car in between. The driver was drank.... and talking in rude language. The Uber is not keeping good drivers.",1
I ordered an Uber and the driver picked up the wrong riders. I contacted Uber and received a notification that I would receive a refund and they never gave me my refund and no one has gotten back to me no matter how many times I have contacted them. They acknowledged that someone else took my ride but still didn't refund the money. Horrible customer service. Or lack there of.,1
"I was having my 18 yr old son picked up and the driver was texting and driving and I told him not to, cancelled my ride and now my account is disabled. It gets better, Im trying to resolve my issue and they are trying to tell me that the email on file doesnt match the one in their records. I only use the one email so Im not getting any help. So I have moved to Lyft!! Screw Uber!",1
Uber drivers need to retake their driving test because they can't can't drive. You guys get confused with directions too much. Uberpool rips off customers to make the most bang for there buck. I was literally late for work cuz we had to pick up some bozo in the opposite direction. And UberEats some B!@#$ ate my apple pie I ordered. Im not gonna go into details about that tho! Boycott Uber,1
Without a doubt the worst experience of my life with Internet based services. Drivers in NYC either can't follow directions or have difficulty conversing in English. I couldn't find a way to communicate my frustrations with Uber. The phone number posted goes to a fax machine or another digital line. I am a SF Bay Area resident and was shocked at my experience. Moving on to give Lyft a try.,1
I have been recently using uber cab in Prahalad nagar Ahmadabad. i have received bill amount through massage from uber cab service. The actual billing amount is Rs.49. but drivers did not agree to this amount is ok. he is taken Rs.104 from me. also driver was very rude and tourchable . i don't book uber taxi service in my entire life. So look into this and short out this issue on urgent basis.,1
"Terrible experience with Uber service today. The rider Roger, Chrysler 300, 7LHV109 accepted my ride request but never showed up and ignored my calls and text messages. My App showed he was sitting near a shopping plaza a mile away instead of picking me up. After 35 minutes in the heat, my cell phone died and I had to take a taxi. Terrible service! And Uber charged me money for its driver's failure!",1
"NEVER RIDE WITH UBER, on new years day me and Jess rode home with Uber, it is not the pricing that upset us, its the fact that the beyond rude driver hit my brothers car on the way down from my drive way. After contacting Uber with images of the damage and feedback of the experience they refuse to help us in any way. Never have i been in contact with such rude people, looks like I'm back with taxis.",1
"Too many times now an Uber driver has come to pick me up, discovered where I want to go, refused to take me, kicks me out of car and I still get billed five bucks from Uber. It's a fricking joke. Of course after a long series of emails Uber eventually gives me the five bucks back but continue to allow their drivers to rip people off. After all, UUber gets their cut so why take these drivers off the road.",1
"Visiting Canada but drivers can't speak English so theres an immediate communication barrier which is not good in a foreign country. The driver never looked for me; 2 minutes are up. I tried to cancel, then found him. He didn't take me but was billed anyway. 2 minutes is never enough time to identify a drivver. No signage on their cars.....terrible service. Beware. Bad business model. Take a taxi instead.",1
This Uber driver in the Arcadia CA area in a black Lexus license plates 7HLN158 instead of making a right turn on a right turn only lane almost hit my car and started honking at me flick me off so I took a pic of his plate then he followed me into a shopping center to verbally attack me and he did all this with passengers in his car be careful if you get him as a driver his an aggressive and dangers driver.,1
"All I can say is if you enjoy being yelled at, sword at, insulted, threatened, having advances made at you, spending 20 min to make 5 min trip because the driver has zero navigational skills, have to rebook your trip several times because drivers keep cancelling, being over charged and double charged then Uber is the ride company for you. I would rather freeze walking to work in -30C weather than get into another Uber.",1
Omg uber is the worse service ever. Expensive and now you have to pool with stranger .. The driver are rude !!! Evey week I have to go to doctor appointment to the same address and I have isssue with the driver finding the correct address because his gps show a different point of pick up .the worse part the driver cancel and I get charge for it BS ..soon uber will lose all his customer because the service is just awful.,1
I schefuled a pickup on Miami Beach waited much longer than was quoted on the map. The map kept changing time to a longer period. After a while I called the driver to see where he was and he said in Spanish that he didn't speak English. I canceled the trip and tried to schedule another and the price went from $16 to $43. I called Central taxi and had a car in 3 minutes for less money. I seriously doubt I'll use Uber again.,1
"I would never use UBER again. Driver was unprofessional he took wrong direction tried to drive me to other state. UBER charged me for that services I never used, I tried to contact them but no one returned my money back for that services I never used but they charged until i contacted to my credit card. I really disappointed and i would never use UBER again. I would suggest people to think twice if they need such a service.",1
My first ride with Uber went like this. The driver asked me what time my flight was. Naturally I wanted to get there early to check in beat the traffic and to make sure I would get through security on time. My Uber driver took that opportunity to drive around the suburbs to hike up the fare. so he could run into traffic. A 45 minute trip took 1.5 hours. I only made my flight because I sprinted through the airport. Uber sucks,1
"I'm a frequent uber user and I had no problems until this uber pool decided to introduce the short walk crap. I'm always having issues with the drivers, as I see an address and the driver sees another address. And a cancellation fee? Are you serious? There are many incompetent drivers out there so why do I have to pay $5 fee when they cancel? I'm saying bye to this service and I will make sure all my friends are aware of your games.",1
"I was late for my work and appointment because driver's cancelled it for no reason, my place is easy to find so I wondered why they kept cancelling my trip. I had cancelled many times...it's not funny anymore "" Uber"" . I am almost done with you ""uber"". This company Sucks! I've been nice to all your drivers even if sometimes some of the uber driver's stinks I was still polite towards him. Now I download Lyft and will try it. Thank-you Uber!!!",1
"Never seen before, the driver don't come for pick up and charged me 5 pound cancellation fee , I called for an other driver , the estate charge was 17 pound maximum, the driver confirm that it will be around 14 pound , they charged me 21 pound . I been charged for the same distance 16 pound to 17 pound with golden line . I tried to call them their's no number for those people. This company is really rubbish . I will never use it again. AVOID IT .",1
"Forgot car/house keys in the car. Attempted to contact driver twice a few hours after the incident, he hung up on me both times after I explained why I was calling. Sent an email to uber with no response. Called Uber- voice message saying best way to contact is through email (obviously not). Went to uber headquarters-absolutely no help. The guy in charge of lost and found there said that he was not allowed to contact the driver. What can you do?!?",1
I always had a good drive with the uber. But today morning I have my exam from 9. I call the uber driver before 35 mint so that I can reach early.. And he revived my call and told me he will reach within 5mint I waited for him for 20 mint and the driver didnot turned up and I literally missed my exam.. please select some professional driver or else it will be a great loss for the Uber company.. (+917636878824) this driver should need to learn a lesson.,1
"In Dallas for a visit with our son, who is a student at SMU. Great Uber ride to dinner, but return from dinner a nightmare. Had two Uber trips cancel and bill me for no show, while we were waiting and with no contact from driver. Will clearly contest no show charge - finally got home with an Uber direct ""off the record"" as she felt sorry for the problems we'd had. Am no longer the raving fan I was - and if it happens again will give uber up for Lyft or taxis",1
"We arrived at San Fransisco Airport and walked towards the taxi rank.We were approached by a taxi driver offering to take us to our hotel he did say he was a Uber driver ( I do not have an Uber account). I knew that the fare should be around $45. During the journey our driver was constantly on his mobile phone either texting or speaking to other drivers. Arriving at our hotel he charged us $95. I my opinion don't use them, i certainly will never use them again.",1
"worst service i had booked cab from kondapur to Chilkur Balaji temple,they accepted booking but when driver came and asked were to go when i said to Chilkur Balaji temple then the driver is not ready to come with us.he reply's they don't provide service out the city and i have to cancelled my cab and they charged me for cancellation charges also this is very disgusting thing i ever faced from uber when they don't provide service to the area.then how can they accept the booking",1
"I have had some terrible experiences with the uber cab drivers. They are terrible with directions and they are extremely arrogant. Once a driver asked me to get off the cab because he thought I gave the wrong pick up address. And in another instance, the driver shouted at me because I told him to take a specific route. I have had many such experiences and so have my family members.. If anyone faces an issue like this, please take them directly to the police station. I regret not doing that myself..",1
So I rode about a week or two ago and I had a few hour drive . Was already costing me enough and I was disrespected due to being trans and the driver stopped on the way never stopping the meter so I was charged extra . Wrote uber and they said they can't do nothing but say sorry and have an good day . Wrote in over and over and there just like again we can't give you credit or anything have an good day Useless and an waste of time Never suggesting them to anyone Worst company in the world Wouldn't recommend them to anyone,1
"I recently used Uber got to see the pic of the driver who was coming to get me and my friends, when the driver pulled up she had someone in the passanger seat with her there was 4 of us guys for this Uber ride, she told me she didn't know there was going to be 4 of us and said the passanger was her husband and told him he would have to go to the bar while she dropped us of since there was 4 of us and needed his space too and would be back for him, this made me feel really awkward and now ill take a taxi before calling Uber",1
"My granddaughter and I ordered an uber from santa monica beach pier . Three drivers cancelled and I was charged for the third one with them stating that the driver waited over 2 minutes for me. I was at the pickup point long before I ever contacted this driver. He evidently left and charged me with a cancellation fee and I followed the rules. Uber has shown to a very shadowy company from the get go. From now on, I will be a customer of Lyft! I have disputed this with the BBB, no response from uber so now I am making you aware.",1
"In suburban Tampa, we requested a car to Tampa International Airport. The driver, Lillie, was totally rude and incompetent. The vehicle had her own personal luggage in the back, so there was no room for ours. Her comment, in barely understandable English, was that we should have said the ride was to the airport. Duh. Apparently she did not know that Tampa International Airport is an actual airport. She slammed the door and yelled that we would have to call another Uber. If you need an Uber in Tampa, be sure you don't get Lillie.",1
"Uber is frud , uber driver charged double amount from me on 20/10/2017. I was traveling from Thane to vikroli. I checked amount was Rs 176. After dropping me he charged Rs. 470. About this problem I discussed through sms but no positive response from customer care. They are not even return my money. Driver create show on the road so I paid money. But customer care people are also frud people. They don't want to resolve the Issue My suggestion is don't go With uber. They don't even have contact number. They are cheaper and cheater",1
"After ordering out uber, we had waited quite awhile and could see on the App she continued to sit at the gas station down the road for 15 minutes. I called to ask her if she was still coming and she yelled at me ""I'm $#*!ing driving down the road to get your $#*!ing ass you $#*!"" after that I told her to cancel the drive because I did not want to ride with someone who was so rude and disrespectful. She needed up charging me anyways. I am not one to write reviews but this was the worst service/ person I have ever had to deal with.",1
"I have had several instances recently where I go to order and Uber tells me it's 2-3 minutes and then I confirm the order and it's 8-10 minutes (tech glitches). I have also had drivers who can't speak English and I must tell them where to go despite them having their map app on their phone available to them. Incompetent drivers and failing technology are not ingredients for a good user experience. When notified of their failings, Uber curtly replies that they work hard to provide the best user experience. Really, that's your best?",1
I was at the airport and figured I would try Uber ..first guy ..we went around in circles Trying to navigate the map.. I don't Know where I am at the airport they say you can contact the driver or text I couldn't Second driver same thing ..you would think one of them would call me they could see I was still standing lost ..never ever again at least real cab drivers call you and let you know where to go and where they can meet you.. I hope they do not charge Me doe those two cancelations that would be the icing on the cake.. Uber you suck Bigtime,1
"I ordered an Uber to get to an interview in Tempe and I live in Gilbert. I had the same Uber drive to and from the interview... David. On the ride there he charged me the normal amount. Then on the way back he charged me an extra 50$ for an ""accident"" in the car. There was no accident I was at an interview! I would love to know what I did. They make up accidents so that they can make more money. It is ridiculous. This is one of the worst company's to use. DO NOT USE THEM. Use lyft they are way more trustworthy and will not cheat you and take your money!",1
"I have a issue with one of my ride which I was wrongly charged. But Uber is not giving me such option where I can write about this or even ask about it. On 17th of jan., 2017 i booked a uber from besent nagar, Chennai to Hotel leela Palace, mrc nagar. First rate estate was showing approx INR 60 but receipt came of INR 130. Then i checked and found that driver started the meter from where he got that i request a cab and drop location was also wrong, he stopped the meter somewhere else after droped me at my location. My email id is tanwarvikas00@gmail.com",1
"I like the convenience of Uber, and have been a loyal customer for a long time. HOWEVER, when TWO of their drivers cancel on me within minutes, and then the PRICE GOES UP for the next one... I'm not a happy camper. I used to refer all of my friends to this service, especially the ones using Lyft.... Not any longer. $#*! this service, their drivers that were disrespectful on the phone with me... My business and my friends' business will go elsewhere. Thanks Uber, for your killings, lack of customer service, entitlement and garbage program. Byyyyyeeeeeeeeeeee.",1
"My wife had a foot operation and we used Uber in Miami against my wish, but the drivers had no training ie waiting for the passenger to get downstairs from their flat. We were over charged and Uber promised but we never got the refunds. The best option is to get a licensed cab where ever you may live, if you go to London ever, Uber cars are more expensive than black cabs in the rush hours and they don't know, even with GARMIN where they are going. PS ; Uber is valued in Billions on the stock market, because they get 15% of the cost of the ride worldwide everyday.",1
"So I used UBER last night... NEVER USE IT! I got dropped off by the first guy, before I could even put my seatbelt on (all of a sudden had to take his wife to work) So I call another Uber (gives me a 2.5 times rate.... with no information on what the heck the rate is, NO OTHER OPTION - that or no UBER, and every time you search another one.. the rate gets higher and higher....) I get home, there's no service.. I tip the guy decently in cash for getting me home finally Get inside, my wifi loads up UBER receipt $79!!!!!!! for a 15 minute ride........... NEVER AGAIN",1
"Worst customer service I have ever dealt with. I was charged an extra $100 for a ""cleaning fee"" 3 days after my trip with no notice. ONE HUNDRED DOLLARS. Are you serious uber?? Then the ""customer service rep"" sent me the picture our driver sent to them claiming his car was dirty and needed to pay to clean, was just his car mat with some dirt on. So I had to pay $100 extra dollars on top of the over priced fare for dirt he could have wiped off. When you drive groups of people all day and all night, your car will not be perfect. $#*! UBER I will never use them again.",1
"I wont ever use uber again, they are very unprofessional and high who ever the hell they want. just recently my friend used an uber to go to her boyfriends when she go in the uber her uber driver asked her if she wanted some water, she said yes. he grabbed some water from the front seat opening it for her. the next thing she knew he turned off the meter and told her it would be free of charge...... the end of the night she was in the hospital getting a rape test done that came back positive.... this uber driver date rape drugged her water and raped her. DONT USE UBER",1
"I have enjoyed Uber until 03/14/2016. Now I'm done. I'm at a Marriott in DC. Driver calls and asks where I am. I'm in front. He says no you're not. He realizes he is not at the front entrance and tells me to walk around back. I said no. He said then cancel the trip. I cancelled, rebooked, the same driver took the route! I cancelled again and took a taxi. Uber charged me $5 each for the cancellations. YOU CAN NOT CONTACT ANYONE WITH UBER. It was easy to get a credit, but not a refund. YOU STEAL MY MONEY AND GIVE ME A CREDIT! Never again Uber. I will never use Uber again.",1
Yesterday was the first and last time I use Uber. Our first driver kept asking us where to go even though he had his gps telling him where to go. Our second driver last night could not find us and kept telling me that I gave him a wrong address when in fact he too could not use gps as well. After 20 min of directing him to us we finally began the trip home. Again we had to direct him all the way because he could not read his gps. WOW! Then came the charge....more than double what we paid for the first ride. Nothing I hate more than having to pay someone to do their job. Good riddens to Uber!,1
"This happened in Washington DC, need to get to the airport. Uber driver arrives, sees me and my family, kids, then leaves inmediately, without even saying why. Uber then charges me a $5 cancelation, charges me!!!. I don't know what to do, really need to get to the airpost, so I request them again. Another driver arrives, and does exactly the same thing. Uber does exactly the same thing of course and charges me another $5. What is this?. On top of all that, no way to contact them, worst service I've seen in my entire life. Of course I am fighting them and I will get my money back one way or another. Stay away.",1
"Always have good experience with Uber but I think their quality is declining. I booked an Uber today. 1990 toyota camry, AC was not ON and didnt work. the seat had some kind of plastic cover which made the experience ever worst. wanted to keep bag in the trunk but the trunk was junk. The driver was irritating kept asking how long have you been in Chicago. He had phone in one hand and was driving with the other and kept missing the direction even though it was clear on his cell phone on he route we were taking. I will think twice before requesting an Uber because a Cab provides me with better experience then Uber",1
called for uber to take us to union station from American university section of DC. initial proposed charge was for $21 then just before pick up got message surge pricing in effect. without proposed charge. agreed since too late to reschedule with other company. pick up was at 9:47 am and there was little traffic. Charge was $55.82. Fee for larger vehicle to accommodate handicap from Regan airport on return was $34 without tip. A longer trip. Contacted uber which was difficult and no remorse whatsoever. Will never use uber again as no trtust factor at all. Car was mediocre at best. not a accompany to be trusted under any circumstances.,1
"Last nite i got a ride to the hospital.I have a bad leg,i can see hospital from my house.So i thought i would try uber this was my thrid ride i get a cab all the time he picker me up at my house.I guess he was in a bad mood that happens i understand that when we got there he charged me 7.00 my cab costs me 4.00 dollars i was robbed and when i went i was pissed i have been there 20 years and i told myy people you just lost a ton of buss every one was going to try it but not now and how do you know if my ride was 1 that got recorder for my free rides in the future. Not that i will ever use it again.You lost a lot of buss thanks captain tom 443 762 7273",1
"I've had countless issues with uber drivers claiming false cancellations, claiming to have picked me up when they hadn't, etc. Tonight a guy picked me up and immediately started hinting that I lived too far away. Mid way through the ride he finally concluded that I did,in fact, live too far away (he just wasn't familiar with the New York area at ALL- NO, Brooklyn isn't in Manhattan). He kicked me out of the car in the middle of the night in a bad neighborhood and cancelled the ride. I had to walk with my three heavy bags all the way home because of other issues with false cancellations and uber. Lyft isn't much better but fewer terrible experiences for sure.",1
"You can't pay cash on Uber, so you can't control how much they put on your card. A driverthat Uber seems to support is to not show your trip as ended. So. The driver picked up my girlfriend and dropped her at my house, both addresses were input in the App, but she got no receipt that day as the trip according to Uber wasn't ended until over 20 hours and 50 miles. I assume the driver defrauded us, or there was a glitch in their software, but after days of correspondence and sending a copy of the receipt, I still get the run-around. I fought for Uber to be allowed here in Miami as the cabs were horrible. Now the cabs are better, and I can avoid being scammed using Uber!",1
It has happened to me 3 times in a row that I had scheduled a ride and the drivers never showed up. One driver never showed up called me stating that he missed an exit both times I missed my flight to the airport. You guys have bunch of fags working for you guys can't tech on time Uber is not reliable at all because they are making so much money they don't care about their customers I submitted a complain last time no one responded me don't have any number that you can call they are just app based and have a horrible service! Driver name was NABIN driving TOYOTA VENZA plate# T694057C don't trust this driver charged me money and never gave it back. Very upset about this situation,1
Your drivers are Horrendous! one of your imature drivers was coming Down Delph lane near the TJs pub and he was not looking wear he was going I was coming on opposite street near the woodhouse garage and your driver bumped into my van and he drove of so I saw him at the traffic lights and he said he was in a hurry to the train station but he was going the totally opposite way it is hirrendous I hope you loos business and I know your company used to be around before you used to deal drugs and perv on school kids am I right to say you had a driver in the back with a school kid so you will not get my business at all p.s no one should go through what I have been through from no one.,1
"Uber drivers are not held to the same standards as cab drivers. They often cancel your ride and the company will put the charge onto your credit card. I have been trying to get 2 of those charges off of my card now for months with no resolution, having sent at least 8 emails to numerous individuals. It seems like you can never connect with the same person to solve your problem and there is absolutely no way to make contact by phone. I also tried to get an Uber out of the country and the guy just never showed. Another driver had no idea how to get to the airport that was 15 minutes away and took a route that took over an hour and I was almost late for my flight. Be wary travelers!",1
"I booked a taxi through UBER, he arrived within about 10 minutes. He drove past me and the on the app I seen him driving in circles. I tried calling him. Then he called me and said he could no longer do my journey and that I must press cancel on the app and order another one. Bare in mind this is on New Years Eve, a 23 year old girl alone, with no coat, visiting her sick mother in hospital. I cancelled it on the app as he advised as I could not be bothered arguing, and it charged me £4 for cancellation even though I did not want to cancel it, he said I had to! As they are ignoring my emails, my bank are recovering the funds. I would rather give the £4 to charity rather than these con-men!",1
"The pickup time on the Uber app fluctuated between 3 minutes to 10 then 18 minutes and back to 5 for over an hour. The Uber car never showed, neither did the cabs I called to pick me up from a retirement community in West Palm Beach two days after my father died. I missed my flight and now I'm worried Uber will charge my card or use it illegally since the app requires you to input your payment information into their system before the car pickup is authorized. At least the cabs I called don't have me locked into a financial trap. Definitely not a fan of a business taking my personal information without providing me a service. I selected a 1 for rating only because this site requires a rating but Uber gets a Zero from me.",1
I requested a ride at 7:45pm I could see the driver on the map never leave his home. The driver calls me and tells me he is outside my home when I knew he wasn't I called back and the driver was very rude he was very rude I hate to say it but mostly all every African drivers I get from uber are rude and they always have an attitude. The driver told me he was not coming to pick me and hung on me I was then charged a cancellation fee when the driver was the one that cancelled the trip. I never have this issue with lyft uber needs to get better drivers I will not be taking another uber i will use lyft or walk to my destination. I find it ridiculous I have to deal with someone rude when they are getting paid to drive me around.,1
"If you are in the Philadelphia area and your uber driver is Daemon, cancel it real quick. When she picked me up she was at the wrong address so I had to literally walk a 1/2 block to her car and when she called me to ask where I was at, she was rude, even though she was at the wrong house! Her car smelled very bad (musty and dirty clothes) and it was dirty! She had water bottles on the floor and crumbs on her seats. I couldn't even dust them off because of the kind of seats she had. So I sat in crumbs the entire ride to work. When it was time to drop me off, she was at the wrong location once again and I had to get out and walk a block to my building. She is by far the worst uber driver and I have had some bad drivers but she is flat out terrible.",1
"Emailed them about an issue with Uber Pool (Driver name Tejan in Mitsubishi Lancer in DC metro area on Saturday night at 8:14pm) and was promised internal investigation but they didn't contact me after that, shared a trip with another 3 people instead of 2, all drunk, one of them with a drink in his hand. I am a girl and was not willing to make an issue and was hoping the driver will do something but he didn't open his mouth to stop the F Words coming from the mouth of the men instead he opened the window and let us freeze in the cold because of alcohol smell. Inappropriate touching due to us crammed in the back, their girlfriend was in between but the guy with a drink kept his arms around her reaching to my shoulder. Uber customer service is a joke.",1
"Requested a ride on my Uber app on July 3 from Eden Prairie, MN to Minneapolis, MN. The first driver went to the wrong location and didn't bother trying to contact me to see why I wasn't there; for this I was charged a $5 cancellation fee. My daughter looked at the app and noticed it said that my request hadn't gone through. She sent a new request and for some reason I was charged another cancellation fee, this one was for $6. The driver who did finally show up 30 minutes after my initial request charged me $60 for a 19 mile trip. For the return trip I tried Lyft and not only did the driver show up within 5 minutes of my request, he also only charged me $18.60! Guess which service I'll be using from now on and recommending to my family and friends? Hint: it's not Uber.",1
"I used UBER to take me from MIA to my home in Miami Beach, the car took 35 mins to arrive to the terminal. The driver that showed up was probably around 21, dressed in shorts, sandals and reeked of marijuana (did not smell it until a few minutes into ride - he had sprayed something in the car just before we got in), he got lost even though he was using a mapping APP and I was directing him. The car he was driving was a Chrysler 300, it had huge ghetto rims, I was seriously mortified being dropped off at my house. The car also had a huge speaker in the trunk, thank God I only had a small case otherwise it would not have fit and I would have needed to call a regular cab. I will not use them again, I did not feel safe and it was just a few bucks cheaper than a regular cab or car service.",1
"Uber doesn't care if you have a problem with their driver; the person on the phone promised me a $20 credit but never applied it to my account; I sent them a complaint via email, they never even acknowledged the email. I missed a flight because of the complete incompetence of their driver, who didn't speak English AND went to the Fort Lauderdale airport for the first time in his life AND doesn't know the difference between Arrivals and Departures at the airport (first took me to the airport hangar, then to the airport parking, then finally found the terminal but dropped me off at the arrivals and I missed the flight by 3min.). I spent extra $150 because of him, for the hotel and getting to the airport in the morning, not to mention the upheaval it caused me at work; and they didn't even respond to my email??",1
"More than once I've had to witness UBER drivers not following the laws of the road. For instance - one driver was driving on top of bicycle lanes and areas not meant for moving cars; another time, another driver was on a side street at a stop sign but made an inappropriate gesture with his hand and halted traffic moving along a busy road so that he could cross over despite not having the right of way. It's not just infuriating, it is beyond unsafe to have these untrained, unregulated, unruly drivers be allowed to engage in such a profession and endanger the lives of others. They might have provided faster service, and maybe this is what they think will give them better ratings and reviews, but I would rather be alive and it is beyond shameful that UBER does nothing to discourage and prevent this sort of recklessness.",1
"1 star because they don't have a 0 star option..I have a previous post about uber stranding me up at 11:00 PM and I had to walk 5 miles to get home about 2:00 AM-- I was pissed. I cancelled uber-go figure. I went to an event at the Fairgrounds in West Palm Beach and I stopped at a tabel promoting uber. I told the nice guy my issue. He reset the account tested it - all good.Need to get to Ft. LAuderdale Airport Mon.16 2016.I want a ride to the Tri Rail station.Once again I see on my cell screen, uber cars close,my credit card last 4 numbers, my pickup address and uber will not send someone because they do not recognize my number, which they have previously. So now I'm late and hit the mean streets arrive at FLL in time and now going to pay about $80.00 for parking when I get back. Way to go uber-- grrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr",1
"it would be a bit unfair to many other great uber drivers i have met but i was getting really angry after some of the drivers cancelled my trips. damn, they are suck. seriously, my stupid drivers were $#*!ing crazy. he called me to ask me where i was, i told him the pick up point i was standing at but because i was in the other side of the road, i tried to tell him that but he talked to me in his broken english with an aggressive voice. he didnt even notice the name of the streets i tried to tell him and misheard what i was saying. he hung up the phone without saying anything and i realised that he was in the wrong direction and i tried to contact him but he didnt pick up the phone. after a while he cancelled my trip. suckkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkk. i am too sick of these types of uber drivers. plz recruiting and tracking your driver selectively.",1
"They did it twice. They overcharge. Last month some driver charged me 390 when it was showing 298. He said in mine it showing this, when asked to show he said you check it again. But since my sister had booked it and I did not have the phone agreed and paid. I did not all her for somepersonal reason. But last night I was a fool I did not call my sister to confirm. The driver named swapnil picked me up from matunga at 9.45 and dropped me at powai. His car was from panvel. He was going to go without a passenger once I get down. The bill shown was 317 and he charged me 450. I gave him since I was in a hurry, instead I should have called my sister and confirmed. But is this ethically right? If I want to spend much money no matter how small or big the amount is I will do it all my will. I do not want such thugs around. Everytime overcharging. Regards Dhanada",1
"Driver never showed and had the audacity to charge me for the full ride. I paid for it, was left with no ride and super late for my event. I finally called a cab - yes a CAB which showed up, more than I can say for MARIO, Jersey City driver from hell. If you see Mario as your ride, cancel it asap. He charged me 100%, for a ride I never took. Never saw him, ever. Uber refused to credit my account,after 4 requests.. So here is how they do business: Charge you whatever they want, and never even have to pick you up or be accountable for leaving you stranded. I WILL NEVER USE UBER AGAIN! By the way, how about common courtesy for a customer who was been a loyal passenger for years, this is how they treat people. BE warned, until you face it, you won't believe it. NO CUSTOMER SERVICE whatsover. I boycott Uber and will pass the word along as many times as I can",1
"I used Über a few months ago when I needed a ride after I turned in my lease. My leasing agent made arrangements for an Über driver to return me to my home. I had no idea that Uber drivers used their own personal vehicles to transport their customers. When the Über driver showed up he was on time. However his car was another story. It was an old well worn Ford Fusion that reeked from those cheap car interior deodorizers. The car was running poorly and was making a terrible whine at freeway speeds. I was gritting my teeth the entire ten mile ride wondering if this old clunker was going to detonate at any second. Also, I didn't appreciate having to listen to a forty minutes of reggae music thumping away either. In the past I have used Yellow Cab which has always been a favorable experience. Needless to say I would never, ever set foot into another Über vehicle.",1
"Car number plate: GFI4CZK This may not reflect the whole of UBER, however, as my first and subsequentially last UBER ride, I think its safe to say this driver was enough to turn me against using it ever again. First, he tried to overcharge my us for our luggage (literally 4 shopping bags), despite it fitting with an excess of room, then he refused to take us when we refused to pay the overcharged amount. Rude and horrible experience which reflects poorly on the whole company. Would recommend UBER to start sufficiently interviewing their drivers so we, as customers, do not have to put up with such disgusting manners which utterly ruined my day. It may be amazing in the US but in the UK you are graced with the most shocking drivers who have no concept of customer service. If you use UBER and get this number plate, then save yourself the bother and find another car.",1
"Between comparing themselves to airlines and hotels at peak season who raise theirs rates which they do but never by 5.9 percent of a normal fare or room charge. Dynamic Pricking ,Surge charge and robot customer service with scripted replys they are a rip off. They are not transparent at all in their pricing. They charged $250 at 11PM for a ride that cost $30 twelve hours earlier. The driver took full advantage of the fact there were many riders looking for rides. There were also ample drivers available He raised his surge until someone accepted. There was no disclosures or an idea that he was charging $250. It is not clear what surge charge is It only states 5.9x. 5.9x of what. When you take a ride twelve hours earlier for $30 no one would expect to pay $250 for the same ride. Beware and make sure you know what you will pay before accepting a driver. They are allowed to rake you over the coals",1
"Uber can be hit or miss. On my first Uber ride:	Going out with friends from a hotel we were staying at in Savannah, Ga. They ordered a ride and it was a great experience, no problems and a courteous knowledgably driver. On the second night out: After receiving a ride downtown on the hotel shuttle, we had dinner and went out exploring the nightlife. Then we order Uber and the app said they were 10 minutes away, no problem. As we followed the drivers progress at about 5 minute out, he called to confirm our location and said hed be there shortly. A few minutes later his location was off and we did not see him on the app. We called back his number and he said he is going to take another fare and we need to find a different ride. What an SOB you are Biell! By this time we were tired and frustrated. We saw a taxi and took that back to the hotel. The moral of the story: you cant trust Uber and you need a backup plan.",1
I have recently been using uber in Panama central America it has turned into a nightmare experience not only with drivers but also with Uber Support personal. one driver charged me 10 dollars for a fare that has been costing me only 3dollars I made a complaint and instead of supporting me they blocked me from something the driver said about me. He was not the person on the profile also and obviously just a friend of the taxi Uber Driver. I found the app malfunctioned so many times that it caused distress to me. The drivers were so rude that they never answered calls or texts. One taxi driver went to wrong place and did not respond to me I waited for an hour for an arrival but he never turned up. The Uber Support personal are also rude and don't listen to your complaint properly I was actually blocked from using uber because of a driver telling lies about me. I have never been treated so awfully by a taxi service in my entire life.,1
These uber drivers have no experience and who knows if the driver is on drugs or selling drugs in his car. Government is actually making it easier for public to easily access drugs. Taxi drivers are more reliable because they go through proper training! Taxi drivers have commercial insurance and their cars are inspected by county officers whereas uber doesn't even have enough customer service representatives. What would government do if one of these uber drivers rape or kill somebody or kidnap one of their clients for ransom and who knows if it's the same driver and these drivers don't even have to go through any kind of training. This uber put lot of taxi drivers out of work! i don't think it's fair because this uber service is just extra money for some greedy people. Taxi drivers were working hard to raise their families so i think government should think about those families and ban uber and lyft forever so people can feel more safe!,1
"I waited over 20 mins for 3 different uber drivers. I got charged the cancellation fee because my stupid driver cancelled on me as it looked like on the app he was getting lost. He made like 3 u turns on the street before giving up and said I never popped out for my pickup. I'm on a public st by the bus stop. Other people were getting picked up by uber on the same corner I was and they all got their rides faster than me. The reason why uber didn't return my refund is because it past the 30 days which I understand but I didn't get my notification until it was too late and on top of that they said the fee is to compensate the driver for his time spent driving to my location. Are you kidding me? Driver never showed up. He most likely picked up another rider on the way. I was at a crowded baseball event. If we can track the driver on the uber app, uber should be able to track to see if the driver ever arrived to the pickup location. What a joke.",1
"Worst uber experience ever. The driver got on the freeway the wrong way going downtown when I needed to go uptown - didn't even realize his mistake. I was yelling at him to get off the freeway and 30 blocks out of the way he finally got off. And then I told him to stop the meter so he did, and then restarted it at that location. Ummmm excuse me, why should I be paying for 30 blocks OUT OF THE WAY. I just paid 30 extra blocks just to get back to where we started. And then I got charged for BOTH of those mistakes. In addition, when he finally got on the right freeway I had to direct his every step bc he wasn't paying attention and was on the verge of missing every freeway exit. The worst part - uber only refunded me the 8 dollars in the wrong direction and not for the extra 30 blocks back to my starting point. Horrible customer service uber. I shouldn't have to pay to get back to my starting point. I was so mad I took a taxi home instead of my usual uber.",1
Driver Gurvinder ( car Tata Indica phone number 9041202861)in Chandigarh charged me Rs 401.51 instead of Rs 74.27.I entered the correct location and I was following the GPS till the drop off. And I was wondering how the driver changed the location because it was correct till he dropped me off. driver somehow changed it after that and charged me extra. This isn't fair- please check driver's phone or how he did it. And he didn't show me that he completed the trip and Once I got out of the car he did something on his phone. Same time I thought that something was wrong . now I can't trust Uber at all. They charged me four times the fare I was supposed to pay and they didn't even confirmed me .I was shocked to see the email of 401Rs. That's ridiculous. I have been doing lot of Uber rides but now onwards I want to tell everyone to keep a check on uber drivers in India. This is very bad experience from uber. I thought Uber drivers were honest - didn't expect this at all.,1
"I was ripped off for $150 for cleaning fee. After a night out, I call uber and got a ride home. I got in the front seat and got home within 12 minutes. The ride is about $7. I got a receipt for about $7. I have no idea the driver file a charge of $150 for cleaning until I look in my credit card bill. I never received the receipt for the $150 until I complain to uber. Apparently, my driver file a cleaning fee to my ride with pictures of the middle back seat being wet and a little mess. I was sitting in the front seat. And if I don't get an alert that the charge was going to tag on, where is the avenue where I can contest this charge. The mess could have been made by the previous rider or the driver lied and file s false report. But if I don;'t get the alert right away, there is no way for me to contest this. That's why this is a scam. I will suggest all rider to take pictures of the interior of the car before leaving the car. Just to be safe so that you don't get rape by Uber.",1
"I am in Boston on business. Today, I send for Uber to pick me up after lunch at Roxy's Grilled Cheese. The first driver, accepts then 2 minutes later he cancels. The 2nd guy drives right past the restaurant. I text him to tell him he just passed by, then he cancels. The 3rd person, I text to tell her in advance that I am standing in front of Roxy's Grill. She calls and says she's there. I tell her she'e not because I'm standing outside the door (in the cold rain this whole time mind you). She says okay she'll be right there and cancels. I go back in the restaurant to tell the guy behind the counter what's going on. Recommends that I walk down to Walgreens and get Uber from there which I do after being very frustrated. Finally, someone by named Moses arrive. I tell him the story and he's very apologetic. I get back to my hotel and see that I have been charged $5 for each cancellation. I email Uber and informing them of what happened and they are refusing to credit my account. Welcome to Boston!",1
"I do not user. My business partner does. Last week in LA I agreed to let her get an Uber to take us to the airport. We saw the car pass the location once and I said, ""We're in trouble already."" The driver came around the block. Pulled up. We had a lot of bags. He didn't lift a finger to help. After loading the trunk I got in the rear passenger side door. While sitting there waiting for my partner to get in the other door I saw him put the car into Drive. I almost said something thinking to myself this guy wouldn't start going before everyone was in the car. WRONG. HE STARTED ROLLING. LUCKILY MY PARTNER, WHO COULD HAVE BEEN SERIOUSLY INJURED, WAS NOT. He stopped the car. I said, 'We're out of here.' Once again, surprise, surprise he didn't help us take anything out. UBER IS DANGEROUS. THEIR DRIVERS ARE NOT PROFESSIONAL. THEIR DRIVERS ARE NOT REQUIRED TO KNOW ANYTHING (ALWAYS RELYING ON THEIR PHONE MAPPING APS) AND THEY DON'T CARRY ANY MORE INSURANCE THAN A NORMAL DRIVER. This situation ended okay, although stressful. But the next time....",1
"After reading reviews by other disgruntled customers, I can see that my experience is unfortunately normal. I arrived at Manchester, UK airport around 10:30 pm and used the app to contact a driver. The app showed the driver was 3-5 minutes away but I waited 20 minutes before receiving a message that the ride was cancelled. Part of the problem was the waiting area was not clearly indicated and local police were not allowing cars to park so it wasn't easy to be met. However, I didn't receive a call and when I tried calling I didn't get an answer. I didn't give up and tried twice more since by midnight there were fewer cars but it didn't help. On one of the ride requests I cancelled within 5 minutes. Now back at home I see that Uber charged me $5 US for each cancelled ride, even the one I legitimately cancelled. I'm glad there's a forum like this to lodge a complaint but would prefer the message reached a wider audience since I now have read that Uber was given an F by the Better Business Bureau. The public should know they are scam artists !",1
I was with family coming back home after shopping. We called uber the first time ever. The driver probably was drunk. He took totally a wrong route and when we said it's wrong he said he has to follow the directions which were shown on his uber device. He just kept driving and suddenly we found our selves on highway. I got worried and ask him to call some one he said he can't do that. He was driving so rough and just kept going on the highway. We asked him to just stop and let us go but he said he can't coz he won't get paid then. At last we have to tell him that if he doesn't stop we will call 911. He just suddenly applied the breaks and we escaped the accident by mere inches. Finally he let us got off whrn we said we will pay him in cash and we realized we were in some different city. We took a taxi and came home. Uber charged us the extra fare and the trip cost us 130 $ what would have been just 12-15$. The worst and scariest experience of my life. So please just be careful as anyone can register with uber so you never know who you gonna trust.,1
"I wouldn't even give this ""company"" one star. First of all, their drivers always cancel my pool trips because they don't want to do pool trips and then I have to deal with the cancel fee and the trip money they take. Apart from dealing with this all the time, about a month ago I was out with a friend and my phone wasn't working so my boyfriend called an Uber for me, about a week later we realized that they had taken $150 out of the account because of some cleaning fee. They sent us a picture that looks like someone spilled water on the door and they said that was the reason. So we told them that I didn't do that and that that could be some random picture taken by their driver and they didn't care. They are not giving me my money back. They didn't even send me an invoice detailing the reason why they were taking that money, I had to ask them. So they basically stole my money. Be careful people. This guys don't care about you, they just want your money. I already deleted my account, I'm riding with Lyft from now on, I've never had a problem with them.",1
"I requested an Uber ride on Thursday the 15th 2016 to take me from my home in Apopka Vineland to a Dentist Office in Dr. Phillips. The Uber arrived and took me to an address that I explained to him did not appear to be the correct address as it appeared to be that of a private home in a private neighborhood instead. I tried to explain this to the Uber driver, however, very rudely he requested assured me that that was the correct address. I got out of the vehicle to check the place out and see if it was the office, but, the Uber turned around and left me there (IN THE MIDDLE OF NOWHERE!!!!) I contacted Uber on their contact line to tell them about their experience on repetitive occasions, however, to this day 23rd of the month no one ever did. This is quite unbelievable for me as I have been riding with Uber for a long time and dedicated; but if I ever have something like an outstanding balance with them they never play to hurry notify me for their funds. All I wanted was for someone to return my messages so I could state my case. Was that too much to ask for???",1
"Used Uber to go 12 miles, simple route from my home to office. I was quoted 12.00 on the application I downloaded. First driver shows up 10 minutes late, wants to cancel on me because he is going in other direction. OTHER DIRECTION.? I thought they were a cab service. Second driver shows up. He is driving a beat up, disgustingly smelly Nissan Sentra. I'd have sworn he sleeps in the car. He speaks zero English, drives horrible. He blew through two stop signs at which point I said, ""stop the car"". I got out, hailed a regular cab. At my office I read that I am charged $37.45 for the 5 mile, horrible Uber trip. I call their office and speak to a young man named Eric, who tells me I experienced ""surge"" pricing. So let me get this straight. You go on the ap, get a price of $12 and then because of some Uber formula, they quadruple the rate?? FRAUD. Unfortunately for Uber, I am an attorney that practices in the field of securities and corporate fraud. I will be on the phone this Monday with my contacts at state and federal levels. This company is a fraud, CONSUMER BEWARE.",1
"At about 11pm my friends and I ordered an uber that was about $30. At 3am i ordered another uber to go back to our initial destination in which we took the same route, same distance, same everything and it was $86.!!!! On top of that, it was my first ever uber ride under my name and card so I SHOULD have received a first time uber user free ride, but the app never gave me one... So obviously I googled a different promo code that gave me $15 discount. So my uber fare would have been $100! I might as well have taken a taxi or risked driving my own car for 3x cheaper than uber. I thought uber was supposed to be a cheaper, easier, efficient alternative to getting a taxi or even renting a car? I will say my experience was polar opposite. I'm never using uber under my name ever again. My driver was nice though, a nice car too. But he took 15 minutes longer than my first driver and he barely spoke English. He also took 10 minutes longer than the ETA to get to us. So here I am emailing uber back and forth asking them to honor their first time user free ride. $86 is NOT WORTH IT.",1
"My first experience with uber was absolutely horrible. A driver by the name of Wylder picked up myself and a friend and we were under the impression this was a safe, comfortable and convenient way to get to our location. It was not. The car (ford focus) was in horrible shape, the seats were tore up and covered in nasty stains. The vehicle smelled like cigarette smoke so bad I could hardly breath, and the driver was very unprofessional. He didn't use GPS and asked if we minded if he picked up a 3rd passenger on our way, we accepted since there was room, but then Wylder drove around for 30+ min looking for this other potential ""client"". He finally drove back to the location that he picked us up at and said ""I am suppose to be looking for a girl named Brittany""... umm, That would be me! He didn't seem to know what he was doing one bit. I felt very unsafe with his driving ability as he was all over the road and made sharp sudden turns in the wrong direction on several occasions. With this being my first experience with uber, I was very dissatisfied and probably wont be using the services again",1
"First, I requested an Uber driver that was 6 minutes away from me in an appropriate amount of time before I needed to get to my destination. I needed to be at the airport by 8:30 a.m. and contacted Uber at 7:40. I didn't want to have to pay for parking at the airport. When I requested the Uber driver I saw that he has 4 out of 5 stars and figured he would be a good driver.  However, the driver seemed to be lost and had no clue where he was. He passed my street four times, which my street is not that difficult to find! He kept making U-turns and turning down the wrong streets.  For a driver, you're suppose to know where you're going! And if you don't know, follow the GPS! It was an awful experience that I had with Uber. I had to pay an outrageous price for parking at the airport and was late for my flight! If the driver just knew where he was going or knew how to use a GPS then this issue wouldn't be an issue!  Since I canceled the Uber ride they want to charge me for a cancelation fee! Uber really needs to test their drivers to see if they're smart enough to use a GPS. Although, you'd think it would be common knowledge... I guess not.",1
"I requested a Uber in Paris and their driver somehow forgot to load my case that had 3 laptops, one new samsung s6 one camera and May brochures that were prepared for my business trip. I found out about it missing at the airport so we had to drive back to our office in Paris and of course it was missing . I missed my flight and so did my partner who I shared the ride with. It cost us over $700 to rebook another flight 2 days later. To make things worst, we were charged 235 euros for the trips and the time it took us to file a police report. I complained to Uber and some lady responded with simple sorry, saying I left my bag on street which of course I did not and it wasn't some public street and I recall very well telling driver to put in tunck and use back seat for larger case. Today and I am in NewYork I missed a call from Paris followed by an email which I responded to both but no answer on phone and still waiting for another call. My total losses are at least $4000 . AfterThis Uber experience I instructed my office not to ever use Uber again anywhere. A simple call or maybe a credit on bill or anything would have suffice. Stop using them.",1
"I'm visiting NYC and was attempting to get the attention of a taxi driver, and a black Lincoln Continental pulls up with a sheet taped to the right window ""UBER"". The driver said he could take me the 1.5 miles to my destination. I told him I'm not signed up with UBER but heard the rates are better than a taxi. After getting to my destination he told me the charge was $45 plus a tip and I said you've got to be kidding. I asked him to show me how he came up with that and he said he does this everyday and knows the rates. He refused to provide a fare estimate and said the fare was based on what he normally charge. I told him I think his practice is illegal and he started to use profanity towards me while speaking very loud and threatened to call NYC when I asked for the fare estimate. I told my friends about the experience after meeting them and they said the driver isn't supposed to take cash for fares because they get paid through the company. Needless to say I'm extremely upset and will never ever trust this UBER invention again. However I do hope to see the car again and the middle eastern driver. In addition, I'm going to file a report with the Attorney General, BBB and other regulatory agencies.",1
"A few week ago my boyfriend had ordered me an uber ride home. It was very late, and when I had gotten in the cab, the driver seemed really aloof and tired. I was very courteous, asked him how his night was, and the response I got was very groggy and rude. Regardless he started driving and when he hit over 50mph in a 25mph school zone, I started getting a bit uncomfortable and concerned. I asked politely if he could slow down and again, he answered with a rude tone of voice. A few days go by and I get a call from my boyfriend asking why he was charged $165.00 !!!!! The driver had accused me of vomiting in his car!!! And took ""fake photos"" and sent them to uber! It was appalling! And the photos he took looked like a crime seen it was so disgusting. It looked liked mushy popcorn and water, and the guy even went so far to smear it all over his car. Was just so gross. Never in my life have I thrown up in someone's taxi cab, and if I had felt sick, I would have politely told the man to pull over. I was not sick, I was not drunk, and I remember the ride clearly. Nothing along those lines had happened and I am shocked uber let him get away with something so terrible. Not only did he accuse an innocent passanger, but tried to steal money from my boyfriends account. TERRIBLE!!!!!",1
"I will never be using Uber again, and I registered a complaint with the Better Business Bureau. Uber charged my credit card for a cancellation when it is THEIR driver who cancelled, not me. I thought it was a good faith mistake, but what was their rectification? ""Future credits"". Appalling! They took MY MONEY, and now they want me to use their service to get MY MONEY back. My only regret is that I cannot do more than register my BBB complaint, plaster my situation on social media, and stop using their service. What they are doing is illegal. Yes, it was only $5. But, they do not have a right to take $5 out of my pocket while not delivering any service to me. Again, THEIR DRIVER CANCELLED! Is this a new business model for them? Have their drivers cancel and charge the customers money so they make money without having to spend any time delivering the service? Incredible. I have removed all valid credit cards from this account so they can't steal more money from me, as they have proven they will do so. I have deleted their app from my phone. I have emailed them to have my account deleted, and I want nothing more to do with such a shady business. I will tell everyone I possibly can about this. They are a terrible, unethical company for stealing money from their loyal customers.",1
"I am done with Uber! Have been using them for couple of months in NYC, until very recently most drivers were fine though I was never a fan of the surge pricing (I paid over $40 for less than 2 miles). Early this week I called for a car, supposed to be a 5 minute wait turned into 20 minutes. I texted and called the driver multiple times but no response. Then he cancelled the ride without my consent, and had the nerve to charge me a $10 fee! Why should I pay for no service, especially the driver was the one who cancelled, not me! He was a no-show and I ended up walking few blocks to catch a cab and late for a meeting, after wasted close to half an hour waiting! The worse thing is, there isn't a customer service number to call. I emailed Uber support and they took a while to respond. I was offer a ride credit but I demanded a refund, as I had no intention to use them again. I filed disputes with both PayPal and my credit card, then all of a sudden Uber freezed my account. They have multiple agents contacting me and asked for photo ID and credit card copy...why would I do that? It's fraud waiting to happen, and can't be legal! I have sick of the way to treat their customers and how they conduct business. I am going to file a complaint with the BBB also, I will not use them again.",1
"I have tried on 2 separate occasions to get a ride home from Uber. The first time, the driver cancelled the ride when he saw that I had a cart full of groceries. I was charged for that cancellation, but later given a $5 credit. When I went to use Uber again, the driver was in front of me, pulled up. I waved and he pulled away. I watched him around my apt complex. after that, I was charged $5 I was asked to rate the driver. How can one rate a driver when you did not even get in the car? That driver was given 1 star for not even attempting to contact me and for just driving by a couple of times. I was waiting outside before he got there. Literally, he was only 2 ft in front of me when he pulled up. He saw me and left. The last time I tried to use Uber again for a ride home from the grocery store (I contacted customer service about being left at the store the first time and was told that it would not happen again) Well, it did. The driver never showed and never bothered to contact me. He cancelled the ride once he got there. I requested Uber again, he cancelled the ride immediately. No charge for either cancellation. So, if there is any Uber driver's out who can answer this... since Uber customer support does not answer it directly. Does Uber not pick up customers from grocery stores?",1
"I was picked up from my workplace on 30/8/2017 at around 8:56 pm by cab no. TN 07 CE 8554. The trip started on my account but the drivers account was not updated. navigation kept directing the driver to my pick up point. finally after taking a full circle and wasting my time he called up customer service. the executive directed him to cancel my ongoing trip and ask me to book another assuring that the same cab will be assigned. the driver cancelled and when i booked again i was assigned a ride 20 min away. the driver asked me to get off on the street amidst a downpour. when i refused to get off away from my pick up point, while it was raining and demanded to talk to customer service again, the driver called up the office again but refused to let me speak. customer service executive told him to tell me that i am not being charged for the trip so get off. I have never seen such behavior in my life. the moment you undertake the responsibility of a trip, you are taking responsibility for our time, safety and good service delivery and in return take payment from us. you cannot waste our time, compromise our safety and then put us through discomfort and finally say 'ok we won't charge you this time'. looks like uber is no better than a bunch of scoundrels with no work ethics or standards.",1
"I happened to book an uber ride, driver accepted the ride. Even after 15 mins i din't see car moving around. I tried calling the driver, he didn't respond. I messaged on uber app, mentioning the address and asking him if he is going to pick me up? Driver cancelled after 5 mins or so!!! i was stranded with no where to go!!! this is ridiculous. Again uber charged me cancellation charges when driver cancelled the ride? This driver has 5* rating!!! When i reached uber customer service asking me to compensate as i have wasted 30 mins bcos of driver, uber says "" Its ur problem and drivers, we can't take any responsibility for driver actions!!"" Why customers are charged cancellation charges when we cancel even after 2 mins, here driver cancelled after 15 mins!!! Uber is a ridiculous company which is misusing customer data and leveraging the loop holes!! Uber should be banned in US and every customer whose personal info is leaked should be paid compensation!! Uber tracks every movement and claims its to improve trip experience!! My suggestion is first do a proper driver orientation and back verification, which will definitely improve customer experience!!! Notice that if anyone has lyft and uber, uber price is lower, but if ur using uber alone they hike the price.... they do a predatory pricing!!!",1
"My son booked me an Uber to take me to the station to catch a train to the airport. When I got in the driver started going at about one mile an hour and drove up loads of little side roads, going round in circles in completely the wrong direction and wasting a good 15 minutes. When I told him I had a train and flight to catch he suddenly said he was looking for other customers because it was a shared ride. I rang my son who said it definitely wasn't shared and to tell the driver to get a move on. He refused to. I asked could he then change it to unshared and charge the extra and he said no. I asked him to call his superior and he said there was nobody there to call. I explained that if I missed the one train an hour I'd miss my flight and there wasn't another one for seven days. Effectively I'd lose my whole holiday. He shrugged and carried on at one mile an hour. There was nothing I could do and even if I'd got out of his car he'd taken me down such quiet roads there was no chance of finding another cab. This was 3am in the morning and eventually after much screaming on my part he gave up looking for sharers - but I made it to the station with two minutes to spare and had to to try and run up numerous platform steps with two pieces of heavy luggage. I will never forget the experience and will never ever use them again.",1
"I would give Ron, uber driver from Sante Fe negative stars if I could. On Oct. 12, 2018 we requested a uber driver to take us from our hotel to Sante Fe airport at 5:30am.The driver showed up, and intrduced himself as Ron. He seemed nice enough. My wife and I got in back, and proceeded to the airport. As we're driving, my wife and I are making small talk with him(where you from, how long you been an uber driver, and so on. Said he was from NY, and had been driving for uber in Sante Fe for 4 years. He started talking about tips, which I thought was very inappropriate. He said he buys water and hand sanitizer for his customers. I said ya, looks like a wet bar back here(lol). His demeanor quickly changed. He said "" you people are invading my privacy."" HUH! You ""have no bussuiness invading my privacy RIGHT, RIGHT"" (yelling at us) SCARY! We said we're just making small talk as he continued to yell at us. Finally, I told my wife I need to record this. He heard this, pulled over, and told us to get out. It was 5:45am, 40 degrees in an area that was dark no street light or bussinesses miles from our destination.He opened my wives door, and rudely told her to get out. He threw our luggage into the street and drove away. My wife is 65, and has a sling on her arm after a surgery. We didn't know what to do. It was our first uber ride, and I'm pretty sure our last.",1
"this unprofessional driver wangjiku, I requested uber around 9:25.. if she don't have idea on pick up location she should not accept the request first of all.. but she accepted my request.. I wait for her nearly half an hour.. I'm giving her directions in the phone very clearly.. but she can not able to found me.. she even don't know the famous place DMV office of Santa Clara, I stressed her in the phone our famous apartment leasing office is exactly opposite to the DMV office.. but still waste driver did not catche me.. finally she is telling that she is going to cancel the trip in phone, but not even cancelled my trip.. because if I cancel the trip I'll get 2$ charge.. so I'm waiting for her to cancel the trip. I wait for 15 mins she did not cancel the trip. until she cancel the trip I can not able to request for another driver.. because she accepted that she can not able to pickup me, then the right thing is she must cancel the trip.. but not even its happened in this case.. so she has done these many mistakes1) she don't have idea of area where she is going to pick up 2) though I'm giving her clear directions she did not found me 3) she accepted that she can not able to pick up me after my almost half an hour request.. but still she did not cancel the trip.. 4) because of her unprofessional behavior she charged me cancellation fee.. she wasted my precious time.. my request to the management is don't give permission to the such kind of unprofessional and unexperinced drivers to drive the uber.. because customers finally get bad openion and worest experiences with the UBER",1
"When Uber runs over its customers. Buyer betware - Ueber is not all that is seems. At first I liked it. Ninety percent of the drivers are decent hard working honest people. But it's a crap shoot. I'd estimate ten percent are unscroupulous and should you ride with one of them Uber has no customer support. There's no phone whereby you can reach the driver or company. Case in point: Take Bill an apparently affable guy who will offer you a beverage on the way to your destination. Bill drives a Grand Cherokee and all indicators indicate that he is a criminal or accomplice to a crime. When Bill dropped me off at Planet Fitness I immediately noticed I left my bag containing an IPod and Bose headphones in the back seat. About $600 worth of equipment. I tried to wave him down but he wouldn't stop. Since then I have sent over 30 texts to him, the local Ueber office, and the corporate hub in Stamford. I even asked the Stamford police to investigate. As of this moment neither Bill nor Uebr care about larceny and they have no moral compass or desire for customer service. The car will get you from point A to poing B but after that your on your own. Uber won't lift a finger to help. Do you reaally want to take a chance with this company when you have your wallet, or keys, or handbag, or smartphone, or lose engagement ring on your finger? The smart answer is no. Bill is still out there. Lyft is the same as Uber. I'll check later today but smart money says they are much more conscientious than Uber who thinks its customer service is of no importance, even when expensive items disapper in one of their cars.",1
"First and foremost, in India there is no customer care service from UBER. There is just a help tab through which we can raise a complaint and that will be solved after 24hrs (taking their sweet time to respond). If a customer is in a deep trouble there is nobody to help. That pathetic ""HELP"" doesn't help actually. There were multiple issues I have faced with UBER. But, today it was disgusting. I got ill because of the $#*!ty freshener used in the cab. Apart from that driver had stopped the car in the middle, ended the trip and told me to get down at the unknown place because I was ill. And I was helpless because UBER has only ""HELP"" tab which doesn't work at all at the time of need. He denied to take me to the destination as he had some other work. when I insisted him he told I'll take you to the X place (where he had some work) and then I'll drop you to the destination. He forced me get down. I had to taxi from that place to my destination (Thanks to God I found a taxi over there), by the way I was charged for this trip which was equivalent to trip charge. Who is going to help in this. This is not the end yet. As the driver had ended the trip I was wrongly charged (more than what it is at time of booking) whose fault it was?? Driver was rude & abusive - UBER has ""HELP"" tab for your security. I have raised many requests on UBER ""HELP"" till now no help. One more important thing ""TIME"", nobody cares. Because of abrupt ending of the trip I reached my destination very late. Who is responsible?? This is not the first time I was wrongly charged, it has become usual. IRRITATED, PATHETIC, DISGUSTING",1
"My wallet was stolen out of an uber last night with my social security card inside and this was the message I sent over 4 hours ago and have yet to recieve a response. I seriously question the legitimacy of this company and strongly advise people not to use the app. I have been a big fan for almost two years but I truly believe there is an underlying issue with this company. Any other customer support system would be much more attentive to the matter and have consideration to help their customers with their best interest in mind. To Uber customer support: I received an unusual phone call from your company this afternoon that made me so uncomfortable that I had to hang up. The man on the phone had a hard time speaking clear English and said that he had contacted the driver but failed to Answer any questions pertaining to the wallet, even when asked directly. The phone call seemed like it was coming from over seas. Unless it was a mock phone call, it has made me begin to question the legitimacy of your company. I have spoken with a lawyer, the police, an investigator, and the attorney general's office. Further action on this matter will be addressed within the next few days because your customer service has failed to make the slightest advancement in helping me. I have been in contact with you for the past 8 hours and have yet to receive the smallest details about my driver, such as his last name, despite the fact that your employee has committed a felony against one of your customers. I am extremely disappointed and will continue to inform everyone I know of this situation and the how unprofessionally it has been handled.",1
"I took an Uber to the hospital but left my expensive cardigan in the car. I contacted the driver immediately from information provided in the app. He confirmed he had the cardigan. He said when he is back in my area he would drop it off. I did not hear back for a while so contacted him again. He said he would drop it off to me but I'd have to pay almost £45 for the trip or he ca drop it off at the Uber offices in Canary Wharf. I then asked he drops it off at Canary wharf. I also asked that he let me know the details I will need to collect the item. My fare to the hospital was £7 by the way. Anyway, the driver whose uber user name is ""Abobacar"" stopped responding to me. I contacted Uber and they said they had tried to contact him to no avail. So I suggested that they switch his access off to force him to come to the office but they did not respond to that request instead they pretended they could do nothing and that the driver is self employed so there's nothing they can do. I filed a Police report and the Police said they had a duty to resolve the issue on my behalf. I relayed the message to Uber but they declined. A few weeks after, Abobacar contacted them and claimed he was in an accident and that when he got the car back the cardigan was missing. So I asked if his insurance would pay for the missing item, they did not respond to that. The moral of the story is, if you have a problem with an Uber driver Uber will do absolutely nothing to help you resolve it. They appear to have a finders keepers policy. It is disgraceful. I still use Uber but will switch to a competitor as soon as I get a chance to find one. Also, I will send an invoice to Uber as advised by the police. I will follow up with feedback at a later date. Beware of ""ABOBACAR"" the Uber driver!",1
"Uber use to be great. Remember when you got the first one? It was so easy and convenient. Now, they are worse than taxi's. Surge charging to 2 or 3+ times the normal rate, app crashes, poor drivers, and above all, weak and unhelpful customer service. Now any d bag with a license can be a driver. Some of the drivers even pedal coke and weed thru Uber. Other drivers hit on girls and try to get dates. We had a driver pick us up in his pajamas once. Another driver had a tire blow out and told us there was nothing he could do about it and we basically paid double for the trip since we had to order another uber. This is no longer a company that is in control. Uber use to be great. They use to be the Nordstrom of transportation. Now, you might get the first car you click, or maybe the app will crash. Maybe the driver will wait 10 minutes then call you and cancel the ride because he's stuck in traffic. Once you get the car, cross your fingers for a cool knowledgeable driver but 9 times outta 10 the driver is out of their area and they have no idea where they are. So use gps, but it doesn't help when gps takes you the ""shortest"" and most traffic ridden route. After your trip, hopefully you get charged the correct amount... Or maybe the driver will contact uber and say your trip was longer than it actually was and they will charge you more, which I hear is happening more often now. At least taxi drivers have to work out your transaction on the spot and you know you won't be charged more at a later time. Taxi drivers are also usually driving as a career, supporting their family, barely scraping by. One of my last uber drivers was a real estate agent using uber to give out his friend number to order weed. WTF? Uber USE TO be great. Now, I'd rather just take a taxi. The uber app is convenient, but is it that much harder to dial a cab??",1
"I have been a loyal user of Uber and it has always been my go-to means of getting from point A-B. But today, I've officially withdrawn and deleted their app. Heres why: Two nights ago, I've ordered a cab for my girlfriend to get home after a huge argument around the time of 3 a.m. Keep in mind her phone died at the time. Her destination was from Manhattan to Brooklyn. The next day, she had told me she was dissatisfied with a pool customer who gave her an attitude and told my girlfriend to ""shut up"" after talking to the driver named Raja. She was tremendously upset to begin with and it caused her to get off the car a few blocks later, which took her to the 1 train. We are super easy going people and we have discovered the driver Raja, has NEVER ended the trip at the time she was dropped off- which was only 5 blocks later and had fully taken advantaged of the circumstances and drove an empty passenge car to her destination in Brooklyn. I did not fully realize this until it was too late - so I had rated him 5 stars before I got the chance to report him. Again we were in an argument so we didn't not talk until a day later. First of all she and I were not drunk at all. And I have reached out to uber and they have refused to refund me for the amount of $27. Although the money is not the issue but the dishonest driver. I will be going to Lyft from now on. I do not regret my decision. Also I notified uber and told them the details and these illiterate workers reviewing my complaint do not even respond to the problem but are confusing that I want a refund because the fare amount itself is wrong. I regret to say that Uber hires lousy drivers that take advantage of customers at 3am. and if they had looked into my transaction profile, I already spend quite a lot for cabs, theres no reason for me to go beyond for 27$ unless it was the truth",1
"Uber driver was late and stopped 50 meters ahead of where he was supposed to be. We wave him down but he doesn't come. We call him, he doesn't talk but hangs up then a couple of seconds later starts moving towards us at 5km/h I question if he is ok when he arrives as he seems either drunk or sleepy or just completely spaced out. I don't want to risk the lives of myself and my partner and her  5 year old son. Driver gets aggressive and doesn't want to drive us anymore after we waited for him for so long. I tell him not to yell as he is scaring the 5 year old and its at this moment that he cancels the trip and orders us to get out of his car. The 5 year old boy is getting out of the car with one leg on the ground when the driver decides to accelerate. This fool is playing a game with his 1500kg car and a 20kg child. We yell at him and I put the car in park so that he cant harm anyone. We advised him we will be taking it up with the Police. Its at this moment, like an infant, this driver begins playing the victim and starts pacing around his car while its in the middle of the road with doors open and hazards on. A tantrum for the adult who realises what he has done is wrong and illegal. I have contacted uber and am awaiting their call. If I'm not happy I have an active social media presence and will escalate to the proper ombudsmen as well as the police. I REALLY hope uber do not defend this dangerous and irresponsible individual and resolve this quickly. Very very disappointed and angry,.... edit: Update - uber customer service (if you can call it that) is abysmal. They are siding with the driver and banning the passenegers account whilst not revealing ANYTHING about their 'investigation' hiding behind their privacy policy. strongly considering posting the pics and videos of the driver and his car online. Customer service rep was Abhi who didn't provide us with any resolution and in fact just made things much much worse. Please don't pretend to care about dangerous behaviour if you clearly don't...",1
"We called an Uber to head to the San Jose airport as we often do. Our first driver showed up and asked us where we were going and we said San Jose airport. Immediately he said he is ""going to have to pass"" since he wants to get home soon. He didn't want to take us that far. I find this appalling - the airport is a 18 miles, 20 minute ride away. If he didn't want to accept passengers then why did he accept our ride? We wasted 8 minutes Waiting for him for nothing. We then called another Uber and she came after 5 minutes. She also asked us where we were going and when we told her the airport she said she had to pass because she didn't have proper authorization to make trips to the airport. Needless to say we were pretty pissed at this point but decided third time's a charm. The third driver was 5 minutes away. We called him right then and there and specifically asked him if the airport as a destination was going to be a problem. He said ""I think it's ok"". Then a couple minutes later we got a cancellation notice. That is THREE DRIVERS in a row that refused to give us a ride based on our destination. It's not like we were asking to go 100 miles away. SJC is the closest airport to the Fremont area and there was no traffic at this time of day. We ended up using Lyft and even with a 75% prime time charge, we knew we would get reliable service and a driver that was courteous and would take is to where we needed to go. And that is exactly what happened. Our Lyft got us there swiftly and with no issues or complaining about the destination. Uber, you have LOST this customer. I find this appalling and completely unprofessional. One cancellation I can maybe understand and brush off as a specific driver issue. 3 in a row means there is something systemic going on and that your customer service model is broken. Take care of your drivers so they take care of your customers. Completely unacceptable and unprofessional. Doesn't seem like there's enough reprimanding for drivers canceling on riders. Use Lyft or alternatives and stay away from Uber.",1
"I will and always have admitted, it's not about loyalty but business. I supported uber in the past because they were getting the job done better than the cab companies. And in a sense they are still more efficient than the dying breed of the cab industry. However there are and will continue to be more rideshare business. Look what Napster did to the music industry and look where Napster is now? Uber has gone down hill for me as this whole rating thing has gotten out of hand. I am on time for my driver, respectful (treating them the way I want to be treated), and despite not liking the tipping I still do it. I don't like the rating as it's pointless. If I give the driver a bad rating legitimately they will and have rated me poorly. Anything less than a 5/5 for a driver is ""wrong"". So the passenger gets bullied into giving them a perfect score. Then there is this tipping which I have been in the service industry and support it but UBER was all about the no tipping and now if you don't tip enough or worse on time, the driver rates you poorly. Personally, I don't care if a drive likes me or not but when my rating can impact me getting a ride, this is where the problem is. Some examples I dealt with is I had a driver in Montreal who didn't speak English and I did the best I could to communicate in French and so my rating goes down. In Phoenix, my driver was soliciting his private driver business and when I couldn't use his same thing. And most recently in Seattle one driver was so depressing talking about how she has no friends and that she doesn't know Seattle well. I had to end up using my own gps using international Data and yet now I get a bad review. I was scared to give this lady a 4/5 yet alone worse. And I have gained other example. I have supported UBER coming to Calgary and Edmonton, even when they were booted out temporarily. Now that I live near Vancouver, I was supporting them coming there as well. Now, I'm starting to change my mind. My point is now I'm considering going with other options including the awkward hailing of a cab! Regardless, ride sharing will continue to grow, the question is, will UBER be a part of this or eventually not exist like Napster, being just another company that started a trend? FYI they make it hard for you to contact them with complaints unless you say you were in an accident.",1
"I use Uber in China, Australia, India and UK and have found them to be reasonable up until now. I took an Uber in Brisbane recently and the driver was terrible. My female companion complained to the driver about his erratic unsafe driving in general, his ignoring of the navigator, ignoring of directions. Uber driver, knowing he would get a one star rating, then complained about us both making 'racist' remarks. I have no idea of what nationality the driver was, it was not even on my radar. My companion sits on University Boards and other Government agencies and is listed in top women business leaders, I also am on similar boards, travel extensively through Asia, Europe and India, we both have no racist comments to make, but we are immediately, according to Uber, guilty. Uber suspends account without discussion with me and then after only sending condescending patronizing emails 'about their community' as they are now also the new warrior and standard setter of community political correctness and protector of multiculturalism, supposedly 'unblocks' my account but it will not work. Despite trying several times to contact them to resolve, emails are answered, one of our team will be in touch, still waiting. Uber's arrogance knows no bounds, they answer to no one but themselves, they are not only condescending in their attitude, they make public claims which they do not back up. As they have to answer to know one except their own falsely manufactured 'community' which standards are set by a mutli-national based on profits, not moral or a code of conduct that has checks and balances denying a process for right of reasonable reply nor natural justice to their passengers. Their complaint service is purposefully designed to avoid human contact so they can make their morally one sided incoherent biased judgement in complete isolation and then make unfounded derogatory unable to be replied to judgments that if I knew who it was I would complain to the HRC. As they have no responsibility to local authority nor reasonable codes of contact and conduct, do not expect a fair go from Uber and do your best to out them as a self serving corporate usurer of community standards for their own profit motive while making false claims against real people of high standing in real communities, expose them for the hypocrites they are. Similar opinion? Write a review!",1
"Really Disgusting! This is the condition of National Capital Region, the biggest frustration people facing here is conveyance and moreover traffic. Nobody is hell bothered about 9-10 hours of jobs extending to 12, 13, 14, 15 hours and so on. A person going to office or market thinks to book Uber/ Ola, the first question the driver asks is DROP KAHA KA HAI- i.e. Where is your drop location. Whereas, its clearly mentioned in Ubers rule book that the driver is not suppose to ask the drop location, not a big deal the rules are as fake as the company is. After waiting for 10-15 minutes, either the driver switches his mobile off, or standing at one position he will say that I am not able to track your location or even he will just sit over it and cancel the trip after 15 min with no intimation. This is not something that happens once or twice a week, this is something that happens twice/ thrice a day. Then for all the cancelled trips they will deduct 80/- (per trip), now if a person doesnt have the time to write them the incidence happened, they will not even return the money back. Even after my last complain to uber, I attached the screenshots and sent them, these people apologized and gave me vouchers to close the matter and said that this will not happen again. But what next, everytime I should write them such detailed mail so that they pay attention to this, they dont even have a customer care. Moreover the driver has the guts to say that JAO KAR DO COMPLAIN or Okay, Jisse kehna hai kaho. Because what worst, just that they will not get the days incentives, nothing more then that. Everybody is just into money printing business, and who is the sufferer, just the common man. Frustrated person, at last when goes to an auto wala so either he will be on strike or he asks for money as per his choice, because there are no rules. Nobody is there to check. Why is the common man working so much, just to get frustrated and depressed, for he is helpless for so many things and at last he should be happy that he has money to get admitted in a branded hospital. Anybody in India can strike for any non sense thing demanded, what should a common man do. Leave all his work and strike for the thousand things that he has to face because of wrong people into business. What is the government doing. Meru and mango are out of business because of uber and ola. If this will be the case, the day is not far off that even uber and ola will be out of business.",1
"I had just arrived from the airport for my trip and was super excited to begin my vacation. However, my friend and I called for an Uber...which I highly regret now...that totally switched my happy mood into pure frustration and put me into the worst mood possible... My friend had took my phone to call for an Uber. The Uber driver was very poor at communicating his destination. After waiting around for a bit, we told him we were at the gate that he told us to be waiting for him after running there in a hurry. He was very short and rude in the manner in which he communicated. Once I told him we were in arrivals, he told us that he said to be departures and cancelled the ride, and Uber had to audacity to charge me for NO service! In the normal world, when people arrive at a destination from a flight, they get picked up in ""arrivals"". I tried to contact Uber, but apparently they do not have a real phone line to call customer support. Trying to get my money back was such a pain and ruined the whole start of my trip. All I wanted was my money back, and I probably would have been fine and a little irritated about the experience but probably would of still continued to use Uber if they had simply refunded me....However, they would only give me ""Uber credit"" to use on my next trip and still charged my card. I told them to remove the charge from my card, but they said that was ""against their policy"". I have talked with a few others that have similar situations happen to them, and they were able to get full refunds for their charged cancellation...but I don't know why refunding my card in particular was against their policy. Seems as if the company picks and chooses who they want to refund...which wouldn't qualify as a ""policy"". I guess they would prefer to lose a customer to a competitor than refund a simple $5 cancellation. That simple $5 costs them close to $200 in lost revenue just for that weekend with all of us using Lyft and other transportation services instead. My first Lyft ride was really great, the driver had even given us complimentary waters and protein bars and his car seats were actually cool massage chairs! Back to the point, Uber is not a good company...there are sooo many things that are wrong with them aside from stealing money from customers. They prefer employees that are greedy and will do anything at all costs to get ahead. I'm not just referring to the drivers (some have which have been nice to me on other occasions), I'm referring to the corporate dogs that devalue everyone around them. Here is a link to an article if you would like to learn more about the toxicity of the Uber culture... https://www.mediabistro.com/employer/blog/news/travis-kalanick-king-hr-fails-finally-ousted-uber/",1
"It's been 2 years that we are using uber, but the kind of issues we have faced in past 2 months have totally washed away the past 2 years of good experience. I'll explain the major episodes- 1. Maruti Ritz- Me and my husband were travelling from sector 57 gurgaon and sec 14 gurgaon, my husband had to get down at huda city which was midway. There are 3 ways for this route, when we asked him to take the huda route he said i can't do this otherwise I'll be in loss, I'll move according to the navigation. We told him that this concept is for car pool, but he continuously kept on saying that you don't know, i am the employee i know. He continuously kept on howling ""mai apki wajah se apna nuksan thode na karaunga"". After damn frustration we asked him to call the customer care and ask, even after knowing the fact, what he again misbehaved and said that ""hum aisa isliye karte hain taki ap baad me ye na kaho k galat raste pe le gye navigation k hisab se"". He was not silent for a min till 3/4th the way. This is highly unacceptable. 2. We both had to travel from gurgaon to delhi, it was sunday eve not too much traffic also. We booked uber thrice. The first driver 6:08 pm when we called him after 5 min he said that he cant go to delhi.. in car pool its not possible. Second driver 6:14 pm, we called him within 2 min, he also asked where u hv to go, i disconnected the phn. He again called to ask the destination, i didn't tell. He said ok, he was jst 5 min away, we kept on waiting for 10 min, no response,.when we called to check, he switched off his phn. Then also we waited and kept on calling for 15 min then finally he cancelled the trip. Third driver 6:39 pm- he too was just 5 min away , for half an hour he kept on saying that i m searching whereas he was not. At last we asked him to reach rail vihar the nearest landmark, its clearly seen in the map, finally he replied "" madam mujhe search karna nahi ata"". Then i shouted and said that i am going to make a complain, he was at rail vihar within a min, bt we had already cancelled the trip. We were late by 1 and a half hour, moreover we were damn frustrated. Finally then i booked uber from my phn and we got the cab. 3. Today in the morning, i made a request for own car from sec 57 to 14 gurgaon. A driver mahinder, hundai accent accepted the request and said that its in pool and he is going to dwarka delhi. The rider he was having was also saying that i didn't opted for pool. He asked me to cancel, so i did. I was booking it for office, in hurry. I again sent a request and again he only accepted and when i called him, he replied i have to take this request otherwise ""meri ye trip waste ho jayegi"" i don't know how. I said i havent opted for car pool, I'll be late for office how does it matters to me k apki trip waste ho jayegi. So what he replied was, he actually shouted that ""to mujhe kya farq padta hai k apko late ho raha hai"". I have actually referred uber to many of my knowns, i now feel like writing these reviews everywhere. This is just not acceptable. These are only the major issues that i hv mentioned, and it actually doesn't matter if u cut their day's incentive when we are facing so many issues with so many drivers. They take advantage of your 6 trip incentive method and it will deteriorate uber's image, u should make it km based incentive method Uber is working only becoz of customers. Dont lose them.",1

I was so excited to work for uber got a nice new car been driving now for 2 months but every nirte I come home so depressed I make about 6 bucks an hour pay for gas please do not be a driver I do not drive for uber any more some one is making big bucks but NOT THE DRIVERS,0
$129.00 to travel across town in Boise. About 10 miles. 1st time used. Saturday on a non Holiday weekend. Mobile app is crap on advising you of your total cost until you get home and your email presents the shocking damage. Took over 13 minutes to get picked up too. SCAM!!,0
"I would like to unsubscribe from Uber's emails but after contacting their support, speaking to several people and several messages back and forth I am still getting their promotional emails. They claim that they have done all they can to unsubscribe me but the emails persist.",0
Uber is a big fraud . I live in Qatar and visited US where I booked uber on 31st May . I got update on 13 June that I have been charged 150 dollars for cleaning. I was with my colleague and it was only 4 minutes trip and no mess has happened They are big fraud . Big time fraud,0
My account was hacked and my card was charged twice. When I tried to dispute the charges I couldn't get through by phone and I didn't get an email back. I had to call my bank and they disputed the charges but still could not get in contact with Uber. I will never trust them again.,0
Uber owes me over $600. They say I must have a checking account even though they have put money in my savings account after my first complaint. I do not have a checking account. They are illegally holding my money and I am hoping to get a class action against them. Lee from Austin,0
"Uber is pretty good for riders - a real scam for drivers, wear out your car for less than minimum wage in most cities - - the amount they ""claim"" one can earn is a lie and a few drunk riders will bring your rating with Uber so low they will fire you - - thank you Uber for firing me",0
"Uber takes the WORST routes! They will take you in circles, then bring you back to your starting point to pick up another rider to make $2. LYFT is no better! Cant wait for more competitors to join the market. Maybe then theyll take their customers best interests into consideration.",0
I tried to use the Uber app to schedule a pickup at the EWR Marriott hotel in NJ. The app REFUSED to pick me up at the hotel and wanted me to hike all the way to the terminal for a pickup. Why bother with Uber; I can just get the hotel to call a taxi that will pick me up at the door.,0
Uber tempt you with a cheap fare when you request the ride only to find they charged you double to the same destination and no tolls. Also the driver cancelled the job and they still charged me. When I complained they said they refunded me but it's not true and never received any refund,0
"On a recent ride there were 5 of us jammed into a little Uber car with our suitcases and the ride cost me more than the taxi I took going to the airport. Watch out for extra charges, user fees. The company is very greedy. Just imagine how much the company made off the five of us per hour.",0
"Uber drivers are amazing. However, uber as a company not so much. The app rarely gets my location correct, the spotify collaboration... doesn't work, the gps on the app sends drivers the round about way. It. Sucks. Uber I once thought you were great. Now I think... Get your $#*! together.",0
My 18 yr old daughter a college student was charged $250 for a ride that cost $45 on the way there. It was her first time using UBER and was not informed of the surcharge which they said was 2.8X but by my math 5X+ her cost their. There should be laws to prevent such gouging - SHAME ON YOU>,0
"I was ripped off many times, overcharged by uber and when want to ask or complain, they of course have a bridge to nowhere type of system where it is impossible to actually state your complain, it is categorized where you can not find the right button. It also seems there is no real response",0
Uber is an absolute rip off. Their price guides never meet their much higher fares charged. You never know what they charged you until you check your credit card. Most times more than a taxi. Rip off on nye was mind boggling. I won't be using them anymore. Best to see an honest fare on a meter.,0
I was charged $215 for a half hour trip. My phone died and I never relized I was going to pay that much. They suck you in with a cheap fare short distance then thay hit you hard with a big fare. Completely unfair and dishonest system. I will tell all my friends and family not to use this service.,0
"I book hotel to airport. I booked for 48sar and finally it costs 84sar when I received the email. This is more expensive than a normal cab. This is more expensive than the official cab which I took when I did the single trip from airport to hotel. Uber, you messed up, you start to be like Ryan Air!",0
The founders and management of Uber have gotten rich on the backs of poor drivers who don't know how to calculate the full cost of driving for Uber. They make a very tiny percentage or they often lose money because Uber pays them LESS than the true cost of driving and maintaining a vehicle in the U.S.,0
I do not recommend this business to anyone. This company is fraudulent and withdrew without my permission 455.39 from my checking account. If you have kids and bills don't use the uber app or service. I use my card online often and this has never happened to me before I rate this company a big fat zero.,0
"Our 15 year old boys hailed an Uber ride late Friday night (February 24, 2017). Well.....let's just say they aided in our boys running away from home. Check out their rules, and it says you need to be 18 to call for a ride, or have parental permission! Umm....not 18, and no permission!!! Good job Uber!!!",0
The worse company EVER! A GROUP of thieves. Was a complete nightmare That I went through. I booked to Canada from Orlando and they sent me to New York. I found out when the confirmation came. Took over 2 hours on the phone been hang up. And I couldn't have my money back on time. DONT EVER USE THIS COMPANY,0
For a ride downtown it was $19.84...to get us home on an event night they were going to charge us 6 to 7 times the normal rate which would have been $120 to $140 ish. They should be ashamed of themselves...I certainly will not recommend them to anyone. They should be required to disclose this information.,0
"App login issue, registration issue. Customer service has no phone number. To solve simple problems, you will see several non sense emails. No one will solve your problem. Bottom line , bad company, they do only show as a good customer service but have no solution for customer. DONT USE UBER, ITS A TROUBLE.",0

Uber is thirsty for money. Even when they know they cannot pick you up within the time stated they make you wait and charge you a cancellation fee if you dare to choose another option. This company is on a downward spiral. Up with Lyft. Down with Uber. How dare you disappoint a customer during Mardi Gras season!,0
Tried driving for them going on two weeks still waiting on the decal I ordered twice. By time it comes I won't be trying to drive for them. Guess it's better then a two week wait from lyft on a background check. Not worth it. Y time you get everything it's the same as waiting 2-3 weeks at a new job for a paycheck.,0
"In the past two weeks, I used Uber twice for one way riding same distance. The price for first time $12.00 and the second time was charged for $54.00. Next time, I rather take taxi with meter and know what you will pay for. Uber should have price quoting before pick up. Reg.is needed to review their fare practice.",0
After a night out got a taxi through uber at normal rate twice and both times said on route but then cancelled the pick up for no reason? Then the price surge occurred and we were picked up and dropped off meaning a £25-30 dare then became over £60 customer support not existant uber is dreadful company to deal with,0
"Not only is ""UBER"" car service a fraud but actions that are allowed by its passengers are criminal!!! Recently, my friends son was jumped by passengers riding in an ""UBER"" vehicle. When the incident happened I couldn't believe a ""reputable"" car Service would allow such criminal acts and not file a report. So sad...",0
We did get a quote ...it was for after a concert double check and triple check because we had heard they change the price $40 was the price but then they told us at the time of pick up it as $350 because of the time ...that was in the quote ? Suck and scam Do not know how they get by with this Something needs to be done,0
"I took an UBER from Pacific Heights to the SF airport and it cost $85.00!!!! That is outrageous! I was not told of the charge, as the driver picked me up at the airport, then stopped at my hotel to get my suitcase and then to the airport. The traffic was bad, but he should have told me it would be $85.00, that is crazy!!",0
"I will never use Uber again! My 20-25min drive turned into $197. Had I known this price upfront I would never had stepped a foot into that uber car!!!!! Where as my regular cab ride on the way back was only $51.....Talk about a scam, I will be cancelling this credit card charge and disputing the charge. Out of control!!!!",0
"On app Uber lures u to money making areas but once u get there,your riding around wasting gas hoping you get a rider. wear and tear on your vehicle....good luck with that. Uber dont care.they stress u to drive but wont help u with money to fix car. Lyft Looks Out. If u wanna drive,Lyft pays better than Uber and less bull$#*!.",0
I did an estimate on a trip that was supposed to only be an estimate price for $20. I didn't realize I picked a sub so after the ride I was charged $68.00. Why would I want to pay $68 if the taxi would of onlyour costed $30 I used Uber for over an year Iat not use uber anymore that was an outrageous price to pay for an $30 trip .,0
"I used Uber last year and loved the service. I again ""attempted"" to utilize Uber last night (Halloween) for my 16 yr old daughter. Guess what? She ended up stranded miles from home due to YOUR inept incompetence. Needless to say, our Uber days are over. We will be utilizing Lyft from this point forward. Choose your merchants wisely!",0
"If you are thinking of making extra money with UBER, think again! It is impossible to contact them, no phone, no direct email. I drove a rider; Uber's app is difficult to navigate, it didn't register and afterwards they said the rider canceled!! So even though I did pick up and deliver, I did it for NOTHING!! Now who can I complain to?",0
I used uber for the first time last night and was quoted $41 it was going to cost me and when I got home and the driver showed me how much it cost and it was $116. The driver could not believe it and neither could I. Been fighting with uber back and forth over email. I just want to talk to someone and not this email $#*!. NEVER TAKE UBER,0
I will no longer use uber tried 4 times today 4 times to request ride it kept telling me to confirm my payment which it did 5 count them 5times EXTREMELY UNPROFESSIONAL GIVE DRIVER STUPID DIRECTION AS a company menat to serve the people IT DOES JUST THE OPPOSITE WHILE CABS A MORE EXPESIVE THEY DO NOT ON a daily basis screw up like uber does,0
"Has a driver with Uber you can except more bad rides. The driver make very little and the company treats them like crap. Harder then a route canal with a dentist with shaky hands to get help. I did this part time and as a Manager of drivers in my other job, I can tell you if i treated them the way Uber does I wouldn't have any and wouldn't have a job.",0
Iam really disappointed with uber charges!! For the last 2 months have been calling uber in different routes but unfortunately when I agree with charges uber declares for a journey in the end I get a higher charge of $3-$5 without any explanation!! Only todays trip where I had limited funds on the account my charges had no issue!!! This is cheating!!!,0
"Today I booked with Uber and when the app showed our car was due in 5 minutes, we went downstairs to wait. 30 minutes later we were still waiting. During that time, the estimate of arrival bounced back and forth between 3 minutes and 11 minutes. We gave up when it became clear that we would not be picked up in time to reach our destination before it closed.",0
"Yes a customer gives a driver a back comment to be evil, as that the driver was too slow when only was a the speed limit. What the driver has to do race in the street to make the passenger happy, and get a ticket for speeding. The driver got suspended for a week, and forced to take a class for $60. The drivers are making money for UBER to be treated like crap.",0
"The driver took ages to approach the location, didn't show up, cancelled my trip.. and then Uber charged me a cancellation fee. They wouldn't refund the wrongly charged cancellation fee back to my credit card. They rather hold it ransom instead, on my ""Uber account"", as if I was expected to use their miserable service ever again. They are a bunch of unethical morons.",0
Uber charged me 3 times for a trip I took three weeks ago. Then once I wrote into help which was no help they charged me 6 more times and never replied or re-funded me my money. I had to call my bank and dispute charged and ban Uber from taking out of my account They are thief's and hope they do not last long. I have now downloaded Lyft they seem to have better service,0
Uber takes out all hard earned money of the driver and encashs persons need They deduct around 35-40% for the fate charges For ex if the fate was $10.00 for 3 miles 20 min journey in downtown Uber takes close to $4.00 and gives the uber driver $6.00 In the $6 driver spends his time drives his own CST on his own maintenance and buys gas in his own Please don't take uber,0
"I began to sign up with Uber thinking it would be a good way to get some money. For some reason they could not read my registration. The many texts regarding this has been annoying. To the point that I asked that they stop texting, emailing, calling. this was the wrong thing to do since I have had so many texts all night from them. I just wish they would leave me alone.",0
I have asked Uber 5 times via email for directions on creating an Uber account. It will not let us do it because it wants a mobile phone number. We are retired and have no need for a mobile phone anymore. I need to use my house phone but it rejects it. How can I utilize Uber services without having to purchase a mobile phone. It does not make any sense. Can anyone help us?,0
Ubers refund policy is a joke; dont waste your time. I had a very legitimate claim and Uber has been sending me back and forth numerous emails for just 16 dollar and they will just play you around. I always thought Uber is a reputable reliable company until today when i tried the service and realized how much they are fraudulent and their site designed to steal people money.,0
So the uber estimate said that it should cost me no more then $4 . Well I went 1.94 of a mile an the lady charged me 4.85$ 85 cents more then the intended price. I went 2.2 miles an back for 4$ just a week ago. This is preposterous for 4.85$ I could have just Walked or taken the bus an it be cheaper to go to an from my location . They ripped me off I will never do uber again,0
Maurice Heyliger in Atlanta area - THIS IS YOU BUDDY! Quote a 40 dollar ride and then upcharge to 150+ afterwards. Nicely done. As you can read from the posts this seems to be a standard business practice. Next time on Shark Tank you can thank that POS Chris Sacca that says he invested in Uber all the time. This company will eventually fail on its own or be sued into oblivion.,0
It is a ripoff for both drivers and riders. Uber gets the money and your car and pocket suffers. Not to mention the safety issues. I drove for Uber for two days; 4 rides. Up to 19 per hour?? Not even close! More like 2.00 per hour not mention you only get paid for the ride to the riders to their destination. The rest is on you! http://digg.com/video/uber-scam-rip-off-for-drivers,0
"We used über to take us to a concert in Columbus, OH. The driver there charged us $25.94. Said uber said he can charge 7 times the regular rate but he wasn't going to do that. The charge for the driver home was $148. He said he was allowed to charge 8 times the regular rate due to high demand. I personally feel that is not how you treat your customers and will never use uber again.",0
If you think you're going to make money with uber / think again this is the new form of a slave labor. as a taxi driver you will receive half of what you used to make with the other company if you currently drive for uber you better stop now..they don't care about you . I did it for a year and its not getting any better the price was reduced and the search pricing is a scam goodbye over,0
"UBER is big big FRAUD company. As a driver,,, please do not sign for uber. They trying to attract the people by offering cell phones, cars by collecting the monthly payments are three times of actual companies. If anyone has taken vehicle and phone thru uber.....their life is going to end so soon. No contact numbers, uber app mileage is different than actual distance. No proper management.",0
DO NOT GIVE THESE PEOPLE YOUR CREDIT CARD. I set up their app just so I would have it handy and had to give them my credit card to do so. Months later I got a charge from them even though I never used them. I called their customer service and got a recording saying the number was out of service. I called the number from my credit card charge and was told to leave a message on their web site.,0
In Salt Lake City my destination was changed after I entered uber car. I confirmed with uber driver my requested destination at my pickup location. Then again when he passed the street I going to. He took me to the location on app that I had not requested. I jumped out of the car fearing for my life. Do not drive off with any car service without seeing your requested destination on their app.,0
"We arrived in New York via Penn Station and the first yellow cab drive was a jerk...the next ride on offer was a Uber car. Whilst the driver was friendly, he charged us $25 US to go a short distance...having caught a cab to the other side of New York and only charged $15 US it was obvious we were ripped off...not a good way to introduce visitors to New York. We won't be using Uber ever again.",0
A friend of mine was drinking to much and needed a ride. I tried to use uber to pick her up . The app no longer allows you to change the pick up point . It was horrible my friend ended up walking drunk on a dark country road for over a mile before I could pick her up .They have no clue as to why people need taxi service . and are so user unfriendly . I downloaded Lyft at least they have a clue,0
"I just spent 45 minutes of my life trying to simply update password and my 'Home' information on the Uber phone App. What an absolute joke. I was in a hurry to get somewhere and made the huge mistake of trying to give this company another chance... all they managed to do was to waste my time. Save time, money and frustration... use Fasten, Lyft or anybody else. This company just needs to close!",0
"We took an uber home thinking it would be better than driving. It was a 25.09 ride which is absolutely fine, but a surcharge of over 50 dollars is absolute ridiculous. Our trip was 12 miles and we paid over 77 dollars. I have tried to call, email, anything to talk to a person and nothing has happened. Uber is absolutely ridiculous with the way they charge people. So disappointed in the company.",0
"I have used Uber pretty much since it was introduced. However, now that Uber tracks your location EVEN if your phone is OFF, i'm out. I will never use Uber again until they change this policy. Deleted it from every device in my family and am passing the word to everyone who will listen to do the same. If your a driver and want my business, switch to Lyft. Big brother is watching and his name is Uber",0
"I waited for almost 1 hour, every time I looked the app kept giving different time updates so I waited since it was rush hour after all in Atlanta. After 1 hour I contacted the driver and he claimed to not have any record of my request and that he had already picked someone else. He kept putting me on hold and told me to take up with Uber. I will NOT use this company again, the app has been removed from my phone!",0
I am an uber driver and all I can its sh*t for the money and you get sh*ty customers Rating is a load of bull**cks. Why would I want to rate my rider what difference is it gone make to me or them Why rate driver just why ... Who gives Damn ? I mean you go from a to b don't matter who takes you Overall I would not recommend any1 to work for uber as it is low pay drivers have no advantage Rider can claim everything,0
"My upfront price was $44.56 last night when I got out of the car at my destination. I woke up this morning to at price of $71.71. I did not authorize that amount. I wish to be refunded, and to have my account closed. I will not tolerate shenanigans. I will also write a review about this incident, and I will look for a class action law suite against Uber. Thank you in advance, Broadway Photographer James T. Rainey",0
Requested a Uber in Las Vegas. Was standing in front of the Uber designated pickup spot for hotel when ordered Uber. Contacted driver after waiting 25 minutes. He said I was at wrong spot hung up on me and cancelled my pickup and charged me. Uber refuses to refund that charge. I've contacted them several times and they send me the exact generic email saying no refund. Horrible customer service will never use Uber again.,0
"I referred a friend to Uber and got a free ride. I made a ride and my free ride didn't work. When I asked Uber to reimburse me they said they'd block my account for some violation they couldn't explain. I asked questions and tried to clarify the case, and they sent me 5 (!!!) absolutely similar emails with NO answer to any of my questions. So this is how Uber support works and this is what you get for referring friends.",0
"We ordered Uber XL for our party of five. A Toyota 4Runner was assigned. It did not have seating for five plus a driver. We had to cram four in the backseat. Several emails between Uber and myself resulted in a ""too bad, it's what you ordered."" So we paid premium rate for a service we did not get. Uber XL says parties of 1-6, but beware. You are responsible for knowing if the vehicle assigned will seat the number in your party.",0
