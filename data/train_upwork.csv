"too many scammers goes in there, especially payroll assistant/processor be aware...",1
Upwork is the worst site I have ever used. 2 times I was robbed by the freelancers they suggested I hire. $#*! Upwork,1
The freelancers consistently charge more than agreed- there is a lot of fraud and bad work on this site. DO NOT USE IT,1
bull $#*! site i ended up getting ripped off for almost a thousand bucks :/ watch out poor quality work and no one is on your side ever.,1
AXhive solutions are scammers! Beware! They are not professionals and will leave you with nothing. The little work I did see was subpar.,1
I hired a Freelancer whom didn't do his job- I disputed with upworks . Upworks wants to charge me $275 to dispute. Upwork is scam their freelancers are scam too,1
Stay away from these freelancers: Modern Developers who is Navneet Kaur and Mahesh Salunkhe! Upwork does not do any background checks on these guys and they jump platforms to stay avoidable.,1
"If you pay Upwork to see the bids made from other workers, there are so many workers from impoverished countries so the ""low-balling"" of bids, causes very little money to be made, if you're even chosen.",1
This site is a rip off! I cancel a milestone - thanks to a freelancer who did not read the job description. Upwork took a 10% fee off the total sum saying they had to process it. What an absolute joke of a site!,1
Paid a so called electronics engineer to design a PCB only to find it didn't work after getting a quantity made up lost thousands But the freelancer is still working via upwork Perhaps it should be called upscam,1
"If you want put your money in the sea, please go to upwork. They are stealers who stole my money. I hired a freelancer who didnt complete the work but upwork has released my deposit which was in the upwork escrow without my consent.",1
"As an employer there's many scammers and real bad freelancers, who's making quick money and run. As a freelancer you competing with millions of other freelancers, with no chance to get any work. So either way I wouldn't use this platform.",1
A complete scam site. Freelancers claim to be able to complete work they can't do and they get paid even when they don't deliver! It's impossible to remove sensitive data like credit card details when you try to close the account! Don't use ever!!!!!!,1
do not use this company if you pay a freelancer and they do not deliver the product you will not get your money back without going though a ton of red tape and you money is lost . You could lose 10k faster in Vegas with better odds. Stay away. Its a scam....,1
"Upwork is a waste of money and time. I hired a copy editor, who actually left out a sentence in the first paragraph of my book. I next hired a proofreader who was so bad I made her give me my money back. If you want either, find someone through word of mouth.",1
A Freelancer threatened to hack me after I left a 2 star review to match their horrible service and attitude. I reported this to Upwork with a screenshot of the conversation and they did nothing and their account says 100% success rating. Do not trust their ratings!,1
"Elance, if you want to lose your money or pay for NOTHING then use Elance. I just lost $1500 for nothing - the freelancers there make there money so easy, you request something and they give NOTHING... Please please do not be stupid like me and use this terrible service",1
I hired a freelancer on upwork to make an app for me.The freelancer logged manual hours and upwork released the funds to him with out asking me if i received anything in return which i had not.So in turn i lost $600.00 and they are putting the blame on me WHAT A SCAM SITE IT IS,1
"A freelancer got my money there without delivering the job. I asked them to stop releasing money to him. They told we can't. That easy, you can go to this website, as a client to release a first milestone to you and then you ca run away without any probem. Their supports are sucks.",1
"As a contractor I have lost hundreds of dollars when the freelancer disappeared. And as a freelancer I did not receive their help in recuperating money from a contractor I worked for. Sh*t customer service, no safety provided but damn do they ever forget to charge their big commisions? Never!",1
I had excellent experience on elance so I decided to give its so called new verion upwork a try. I hired workers for several projects but each time my experince was pathetic. Possibly this site is crowded with fake workers who show great work on their profile but actually deliver crap. Will never recommend.,1
"i hire a freelancer with very good skill, i invest $5490 to get my website done for company, but suddenly the person disappear and i cant get my payment back, upwork saying the freelancer account suspended and now i m in middle of work, :( very bad support very bad company, care dont put large amount on them",1
Freelance ripped me off totally and Elance will do NOTHING about it. Elance customer support tells me they can give refund my money IF THE FREELANCER would contact them. Well that makes no sense. The freelance ripped me off and so did ELANCE. What a bunch of scammers! Going to ripoff report and let them know too of how bad ELANCE has been.,1
Avoid Upwork at all costs when you require a software project. My experience is that Upwork will protect scammers and allow them to keep on working after taking your money. Software projects require time to iron out all the bugs and the Upwork platform will not allow you to modify reviews when freelancers do not complete their work but keep your money.,1
"Not superb though, not user friendly either. I am satisfied because I found cheap labour but not quite satisfied with their performance. At first they were excellent but then started to let me down more and more. I ended up doing the job myself which is complete opposite of why i joined in the first place. Never mind, I am sure someone better will come along.",1
This is the worst site ever. Any freelancer I've hired from there has ruined things on my site and has cost me double to have their work fixed. Anybody can sign up and say they have experience. To prove it I signed up as a SEO specialist (I have zero experience) I was given rising talent status by upwork for completing a couple things on my profile. Stay away!,1
"By any scale a WORST COMPANY. This Company's motto is to how to steal your money. As a Client, you will come across Freelancers who will falsely promised you to set a Milestone to have the Project delivered. Then these Freelancers will take your money and will run away. They make false promise and UpWork is completely involved in this Practice. Don't do any business with UpWork",1
"Don't waste your time with this. I had 2 ""pros"" accept my project. The last guy quit. Said it was to hard and had other jobs coming in. I'm very disappointed in eLance. Both said they could knock it out in a few days. The first guy was working on everything I had asked him not to mess with. The second guy kept wanting more money. Then he quit... I've wasted a month with those guys.",1
they approve payment to freelancer without my approval and the freelancer did not do the job nicely. And the help center asking me to pay 290usd to help me to get the money back. i hate their help center. IF you going to use upwork do not pay dispute money without the job complete so they can not steal your money. Guys use separate credit card for the payments just use the exact amount.,1
"I sent refund request, that has been accepted by freelancer. I have filled a statement of work etc, specified i get a refund if something goes wrong. Freelancer did accept the refund request of mine, however since they do not have money on their account i have to wait till they do top up their account, which obviously never going to happen. What da f**k is refund request for if not to get your m*********g money back?",1
"There is not any security at Elance, no control over freelancers. I was stolen 500$ by a scam freelancer. They use automatic PayPal payments, disappear in a few days and delete the profile. You can start a dispute but there's nothing to do. PayPal wil request a refund to Elance, the will reject it and they will tell you to dispute with the ""disappeared"" freelancer. DON'T work with this company, they should be shut down.",1
"I wasted 2 weeks working with a fraudulent freelancer on Upwork.com I didn't notice until after he got nearly $1500 out of me. Just 1 day he disappeared and stop responding to my messages. Worst thing about it is that Upwork refused to refund the money! No worries, I just called my bank to handle it but now I'm behind schedule and need to find a reputable freelancer to create my project. Beware of these scam artist, they are everywhere!",1
"Just a short note. I have hired over 23 freelancers and completed over 30 jobs on elance in the last 4 years. I had a problem with one freelancer and attempted to resolve via their very confusing process. I could NEVER get anyone to speak to me on the phone. In short, I paid a freelancer $219 for work that was never performed correctly and Elance did not speak with me to resolve. They would only send emails. Not acceptable to me. I am moving away from them.",1
"The last job posting I put on upwork resulted in multiple DIRECT calls to my phone, work email address, skype address, personal email address, google chat. They all mentioned they saw the job posting on upwork and its the only place I posted. Its overwhelming and I will not use upwork again for a job posting. They found the email of a consultant to my business and emailed him. Unless you are lonely and like contact from strangers who want you to hire them, stay away.",1
"Had small job started by freelancer. Was so bad I fired him. He billed me for $80 for time spent working on a project which he never delivered, and for sample work that was so bad I couldn't even use that. Contested with PayPal, which was denied. Disputed with Upwork, which was denied. Beware - PayPal protection absolutely useless and Upwork protection a joke. DO NOT USE. There are others...or you get someone local that understands English and has some degree of ethics.",1
"UPwork is a total rip-off. Two weeks and $160 hours later, I find out that the project my programmer said he can do, is still not fixed and there is no hope that he can fix it. If you value your blood pressure and your wallet, do not use this system...there is a reason they are so cheap...to scam you into using them. Add Upwork to the latest scams on the Internet along with diet fads, and get rich quick schemes...(except for them...they are probably laughing all the way to the bank.)",1
"Elance has 161 complaints with BBB in last 3 years! FACT! Do not use their services. They provide no protection for you and allow their freelancers to do what ever they want! I paid over $5000 for a website that never worked, they won't do anything and will continue to allow this freelancer to take money from unprotected customers. Plus this freelancer held my passwords ransom unless I gave them a good review. BE WARNED! ELANCE can't protect you! *I would have left no stars checked if I could have!",1
"I used Upwork for the first and it was the last time. Their freelancer delivered not functional website, I asked for a full refund, they said I need to ask freelancer. When I contact him for refund, he blocked me. I contacted Upwork again, sent them all necessary information about the work I was promised and what I recived, all messages...and after several emails they said that they just connect freelancers and clients and they cant do anything about my case. I lost my money and received very very poor website.",1
"Been hiring freelancers through Elance for close to 3 years now. Found some great freelancers and some not so great freelancers, But my beef is with the site itself! It is full of bugs that cost me a lot of my time and it has been going on for a long time now. Today I looked through the site for a place to write to them about their bugs and to my surprise there was no way to contact them. No phone number, no email, no form to fill in. Or it was so well hidden that... But seriously, in this day and age you do that?",1
"I want to know which FEDERAL AGENCY I can ask to investigate this group. They take money into escrow and then it magicallly disappears. Freelancers write with complaints about money and completed work disappearing. The site is IMPOSSIBLE to navigate, with tabs and labels that make no sense. Oh! Do NOT enroll or sign up. So much of my outsourced work has been lost, incomplete, late or never even received by the bidder. On a side note, the freelancers are non English speakers who really cannot handle even mildly sophisticated projects.",1
"Many years ago I had used oDesk to find freelance website developers. I had some success and was general satisfied. Then Upwork purchased Odesk and it all changed. The biggest change was in the trustworthiness of their freelancers and the way they made it impossible to work with their freelancers to manage websites without risking getting ripped off by the freelancers. I finally did get ripped off by a freelance so bad I will never use them again. If anyone wants to know who the Upwork freelancer that scammed me was, feel free to contact me at 570 975 5805",1
"please do not use this website, is the worse nightmare. bad customer service, over a week with a issue. this people would tell you pay me by hour so they spend incredible amount of hours working in something would take less that 1 hour, i paid for 50 hours, the person told me that they were going to make my website, I stopped the work because after billing me for 50 hours the only thing they did is send me a template and change 5 picture in the template, and that was their work, after 2 weeks, my website got not changes and they are refusing to issue a refund.",1
"Good luck to you if you hire through UpWork. Once you are set up to pay your freelancer and money changes hands, it's GONE. UpWork will not give you a refund, even if the freelancer overcharges for the work done, conducts themselves unprofessionally and compromises the security of your website. UpWork says that unless the freelancer agrees to a refund, there is nothing they can do. So why use UpWork? I am not sure, as you'd be just as well off to throw your money at someone on the street corner. There is no protection against unskilled, unprofessional freelancers on UpWork.",1
"Got linked up with a freelancer and it was going well until I realized there was no way this person could accomplish the task, and then you are just screwed. The freelancer was making 8th grade graphics, literally thought it was a joke when it first was submitted. I would never use this site again because of the process, you should get a trial period to see if the person can actually do what you are looking for. Do not ever use this site, and if you do then know how much risk you are taking. I'm sure there are good freelancers on there but few and far between, good luck hunting.",1
"We got ripped off by our freelancer. Elance released the funds they held from us to the webdesigner even though he had never finished the job. We called the customer service: unfriendly, unprofessional, giving us the feeling that they did not care and above all they did not do anything to get back our money or to make sure our website would be finished. In the end we even got charged for copyright violation by GettyImages because the webdesigner had used stolen material from the web. I do understand all the good reviews from freelancers: they can basically do whatever they want!",1
"Upwork hires criminals. I discovered this when I found that one of their freelancers has 3 convictions of violent crimes. UpWork responded that they do not discriminate and what a freelancer does with their personal time is not their business. However, some freelancers meet face-to-face and could be using Upwork to cause harm or commit more crimes. UpWork has no idea if any of the freelancers they ""connect"" with others are violent offenders, predators, sex offenders, pedophiles, etc. because they feel they have no duty to let you know this information. I would never recommend them.",1
"I spend over $25000 on Upwork but when I hire (most Indian) freelancers they where all a disaster. No deadline reached, they lie about the work which is not done to get a payment, they log in for more hours. They drag the project to keep your for long time to benefit the payment. I hired a Indian company who had a good feedback on Upwork. But then I found out they gave my work to students so they can focus on getting more projects. At the end you pay triple the price than developing it in your country. No outsourcing for me anymore. I WILL NEVER EVER USE UPWORK ANYMORE!!!! amsterdam200@hotmail.com for proof",1
"The project ""e-commerce website"" order was made 3/29. The freelancer has not delivered the first milestone ""Beta site delivery"". Claimed the refund but nothing is happening. As of 4/22, UpWork confirmed by email. You requested a refund for your unused deposit of $250.00. If the freelancer ""NANCY KESHARY"" does not respond to your request within 7 days, the remaining balance in escrow will be automatically refunded to your payment method. Checking with the support team, the deposit had already been released to the freelancer 4/5. Now I claim to Paypal to get my full refund from Upwork. DO NOT TRUST WHAT THEY CONFIRM YOU!!!!",1
"I have very mixed experiences with upwork, no good ones for SEO, some lovely ones for a marketing adviser and photoshopping of images, but terrible for website design. Am in the middle of a dispute now, the designer was supposed to do design templates for 3 specific pages, and the layouts, looked great. However his integrating was and still is a mess, affecting text and layout on all the pages, to the extent, that I am now having to spend hours undoing and re-doing all the work. And the upwork view..."" it appears that no clear violation of our terms has been made""So sure, use them, but you are entirely alone if it goes wrong.",1

"Terrible, I wanted someone to do some marketing for me, he sent me pictures of the Pakistan army with ak-47s and women with plates of money in their hand. I disputed and Elance claimed that I should pay him because he did the work in good faith. I even told him before we started the project that I did not want him to do anything for me and he still did it. He then called me a fraud. Wow, I guess I am naive to the real world for having faith in him. I have recently re-disputed the matter and is currently ongoing. Elance and all of those similar sites are too expensive and you have to compete with people who are willing to work for $5 per hour.",1
"They are terrible company. if you dont trust me then please go ahead and try it... I have hired a lady for website...she has given no input to get any work done in last 4 weeks and guess what they keep taking money from my account. after several messages i decided to cancel the contract but Next week they took money again from my account. REMEMBER, ONCE YOU HAVE PUT YOUR ACCOUNT DETAIL YOU CAN NOT CANCEL IT..TRY IT.. Where ever they are they are making fortune from UK market and because they are international and out side of UK so they dont fall under UK legislation.... Please please just careful using this platform, you just lose the money and regret.......",1
"Be very careful who you hire on Upwork because if things go wrong, Upwork's powers of mediation are none existent, even if you present an infallible case! Having raised such a case for mediation - due to freelancer unable to complete the job as agreed, as well as overcharging despite agreeing a fixed fee! - they simply didn't want to know. It is my opinion that Upwork's allegiance is firmly with their freelancers who, lets face it, pay them a big commission (20%!!) for each job they get. So if they were to award in favour of the Client, it would dent their own profits! (where's the sense in that!?!) Upwork mediation - Inept, toothless and bordering on unethical. Hence the review.",1
"You have to be very specific about what you want. Otherwise you will pay for nothing. Because from the seller point of view, they cannot work for days in order to satisfy you. On the other hand as a buyer you except something that the seller must do it in a big percent of of what you expect. And if the seller is not be able to do it? Have not the skills? If the product delivered is not what you expect you will pay for it... and you will not be able to argue or get a refund. Just be careful. I would put average to good, but because I ordered a work I paid a lot and I received nothing that I can use, and I have to pay again for something and start it from the beginning I put 2 stars.",1
"The idea of Upwork is actually quite a good one. Find a freelancer matching the skillset you need, and pay competitive prices for it. However, as seen with the majority of the rest of these reviews, they don't actually offer any protection to the customer, with cowboy freelancers rife. I've now used three different freelancers that have blatantly lied about their skills in order to get paid. Upwork claim that they have buyer protection in place, but their system to refund is flawed and doesn't make sense for the workflow of any business. All the protection is on the freelancer, use with caution and if in any doubt, claim before 30 days after first payment. My advice: avoid, use a competitor.",1
As an employer I have hired more than 10 freelancers on Odesk (now Upwork)- There are so many FAKE freelancers there!!!!. There is no control from Upwork. I was interviewing a person for Voice over Artist. I wanted exclusively Canadian. All the people whom I approached and they claimed to be in Canada were FAKE. Also recent disappointment. I hired an Arabic translator for a user manual. They guy puts the 12 page English manual in a software and spit out crappy Arabic translation and sends me out in 20 minutes... LOL. I refused to release the money in Escrow. Uprowk now claims that they have to write to freelancer and ask him to approve the refund!!! WTH is going on with you guys!!!! Truly disappointed.,1
I had an issue with a freelancer I hired going MIA. He got paid for 1/2 the job went and then went silent. Upwork is more concerned with keeping every dollar than admitting when something goes wrong and correcting it. You provide security for the freelancer but what security do the people and companies hiring these freelancers get? After months of dealing with the very unprofessional CS team they FINALY came to a resolution when they could't get in contact with the freelancer either. They were suppose to refund my money back to my credit card as I explicitly stated. They gave me a credit and it was used my another person on my team. HENCE ME EXPLICITLY stating refund back to the original form of payment.,1
"I'll give them 1 star because you can get projects without having experience. But the rest is out of this world. They perform certain check ups (fine by me) that have 0 relevance regarding certifications. How cand be relevant a 5 minutes chitchat on camera, with 0 question about one's background? Theeeeen comes the switch-to-private-mode actions even though i have ongoing contracts. Obviously, this would have never happened if i had a premium (paid) account - or at least this was their answer to my inquiery. And then comes the contract blockings, money blockings and any kind of blocking could cross your mind. I think it cand be alright-ish for some extra money, side projects, etc. If you can bear the harassement",1
I have had great success with similar platforms over many years so thought I would try Upwork. The developer ignored my entire requirements and just produced a single page that was more limited than our mock-up page. He managed to get me to pay half up front though and was demanding the rest! I tried to contact upwork about it and they passed it off to some other company for arbitration. They didn't respond for weeks and then asked a few obvious questions and then never showed up again. I cannot even leave a review on the project to warn others! They don't care since they are holding my funds!!! This is a total scam! When I contact them they say they have too many claims to keep up with them so they cannot do anything!!!,1
"I would grade lower since I did manage to hire a relatively good freelancer on the platform, however the reason I'm giving Upwork a 1 star grading is far more significant. It's on more than one occasion freelancers misrepresented their work history by claiming work they haven't done. Upworks response, other than a generic ""we will look into it"" was that they can take responsibility only for the projects that were done on it's platform, but they do not take any responsibly for a freelancers' lies in regards any work that was done through a different medium. A valid excuse for a startup, not a multi million $ company that is just trying to waver any responsibility. I had no choice but to contact the affected companies directly .",1
"1. Allows Freelancers to log unauthorized hours and FORCE you to pay for work that you never asked for. 2. Allows those exact same Freelancers (who you have worked with for less than a single week) to leave you a one star review for pointing out their illegitimate logging of hours to steal your money. 3. Removes YOUR feedback on the thief Freelancer's account for pointing out they forcefully log work hours whether you ask for them or not, allowing them to continue their inexcusable theft. 4. Gives you a button to close your account, only to tell you ""Your account cannot be closed at this time."" Inexcusable performance from a company that directly participates in stealing your money. Completely inexcusable. Avoid this site completely, if you can.",1
"Hello Friends,  Here is a Hillary experienced with these fools. IT's a platform for Freelancers to compete Technically and Bid financially. They clearly respond that there are many people with same skills and wants to avoid compete. More over they do not understand simple english. They need sophesticated words of technology to use, Heavy weighted Technical Terms. Funny Part is people are selling approved accounts or paying money to get approved. This makes no sense of joining. This platform charges 20% first as Commission and later 10%. It's better to avoid as this site is promoted by a UNION of particular platform to Diminish rival software companies and dominating on a single platform. A good programmer will understand the above concept well. don't want to get drag legally.",1
"Freelancer, Malek A ,overcharged me for work that there is no way to check. Went on vacation in middle of job. Then when it came to testing his work took it offline and blackmailed me to only restore our server to test it if we pay full overcharged amount. Asked me to pay not on upwork but with bitcoin. Upwork customer support did nothing and took his side. The freelancer only had a couple of small jobs for little money, which were probably planted reviews. Got scammed but very dissappointed because upwork didn't do anything. Still lost a lot money that I paid directly through paypal because upwork won't ask back for money from freelancer. Never in my 70 years have I been treated so poorly by a company. See screenshot of my chat with customer support where they say they can't do anything.",1
"I see alot of poor reviews from freelancers, but everyone should know that the employers get screwed as well. From the perspective of the one providing the work, I have found that eLance playing field tilted WAY too far towards the freelancer. So much so that when the freelancer doesn't do the work, they get paid. On top of that, since I complained to eLance about the freelancer not doing the work and refused to pay, I seen to have a 500% increase in spam and viruses sent my way through email. How about that. Elance cannot continue sitting back and paying freelancers when there is no proof of work being completed except for a timesheet. I agree with the review that this is a VERY poorly run escrow company. They do nothing to ensure that a product is delivered and that the product is paid for.",1
"I just experienced the biggest nightmare of my life, working with an Upwork vendor. He's a 3D animator by the name of Sergey Petrukevich. He repeatedly tried to blackmail me for more money throughout the job. I kept Upwork in the loop during the project and afterward, asked them to sandbox him for good so he could not attempt to extort anyone else.They PUNISHED ME! Upwork obviously approves of their vendors holding clients to ransom for more money. It now all makes sense. The more a vendor robs a client of additional monies, the more Upwork gets paid. If you value your wallet and your sanity, avoid Upwork like the plague. For me, this was like fending off a rapist, reporting him to the police and then being thrown in prison for assaulting the person who tried to rape me. Yes, it was just about this bad.",1
"elance is a company of scammers Most of their contractors are scammers Indians Aman Aggarwal Expert in Databases and Server Administration: is a good example https://www.elance.com/s/aman-aggarwal-dba/ I worked with him and he just stole my money All his reviews are fake Notice the number of overall reviews of users who submitted the reviews 1 or 2 He delayed the project over 30 days and then disappeared I turned to elance to get refund But their response was: As there are no funds currently held in Escrow and the last payment released from Escrow was more than 30 days ago, the job does not qualify for a Dispute Assistance call or arbitration through Elance. We can not issue a refund without the freelancer's consent. I told them that the work was not performed There is no response from them! elance = scam, aman619aggarwal = Indians scammers Fraud Scam company !",1
"I had a skirt that I wanted a pattern for.elance has pattern makers so I thought this is perfect. Submitted a photo and got a reply and hired this guy who I will name later.in reading his resume it states in printable format,so I ask for PDF format.maybe I do not know the ins and outs of pattern making but I knew what I wanted.so once it was finished he sent and I could not get it to print in any PDF.tried for days,finally frustrated told him this is not what I paid for I needed to print it out.but evidently printing on a4 copy paper cost more money,now I'm mad.not willing to pay more.so he sent me the measurements and for about a week I tried to make the pattern by his measurements,only to finally get it sewed together and it was not right.completely different skirt.wasted my time and money here.do not buy from pattern maker unless you know the ins and outs of pattern making.never again!",1
"This website is absolutely awful. I must admit the way they set it up isn't bad.It is easy to navigate, but holy crap the freelancers on this website are terrible. I have only done one project on this website and it was a disaster. I asked the first guy I hired to make a cartoon Donald Trump. I thought the design was great until I found out he took the image straight off google images. Then I asked to make a cartoon Hillary Clinton and he absolutely butchered that. It took him for times to actually make the revision I asked for then when I asked to add something he wouldn't do it because he said his design looks more professional. So I fired him. Next I hired someone for the same project and it took 4 days to get any kind of update from him. My work was still not complete. 3 days later still no design. And to top things off the website goes down for at least 2-3 days a week... THIS WEBSITE SUCKS!",1
"Has to be the worst, most incompetent, scamming company in the history of scamming companies. The Freelancer I hired was obviously working on other things while supposedly working on my site and yet Upwork would still not refund any of my money. Even though there are clear screenshots of him working on things other than my site, and it took him 6 hours, over a 1 week period to do 30 minutes worth of work, in such a shoddy manner that it had to be redone, they still refused to refund me anything. On top of that they accused me of trying to pay the person offline, without any evidence whatsoever. The other freelancer I was working with at the same time was a bit better, but I have to say, if you ever hire someone to work on your site, never pay them by the hour. Always insist on a flat fee with a guarantee of what will be done and insist on a set refund if it isn't and pay as they go with strict milestones. such a ripoff!",1
"Well, I have to say I have not been having good luck with freelancers. I posted a project on upwork.com and shortly after that I received an upbeat message from upwork.com saying ""XXXXX is a great fit for your job."" I had a quick look at the resume of XXXX and his experience looked great, hired him on the spot. Well since he had such a great reference from upwork I gave him the benefit of the doubt and let him bill a couple weeks of work without checking into it in much detail. Well $1100 later and none of the work is done. Reviewing his work log he was spending time looking for other freelancer jobs, browsing the net, not one screen of coding the features I was asking for. I cancelled the project immediately and wrote to upwork to check into it. They shrugged and said its been too long, I should have complained 'within the work week' which is four days. Lesson learned: Don't give upwork.com the benefit of the doubt with their suggestions, even if the candidate looks good there are scammers operating on their site.",1
"I recently signed up at Upwork and had my first project which took me about 1 day of work. All seemed to be perfectly normal. I completed the project the client approved payment and then suddenly my account was blocked. After reaching out to the Customer Service, they informed me that I had to verify several details. Which I did, then they asked if I could reach out to my client as there was a problem they could not explain. I reached out to the client and didnt get an answer. Then I mailed Upwork during a period of 2 months several times, I hardly got any response, sometimes it took over a week to get a respond from Upwork. Today I received the message (see screenshot attached) that because my client was fraudulent they won't be paying me for my completed work. It has been a terrible experience working with this company. There CS is rude, unprofessional takes ages to respond and the worst: they won't pay me for my completed work. I strongly advice to not work with Upwork if you don't want to lose your money. This company is a mess!",1
"I got lucky the 1st 2 people I hired so I was not expecting any problems. 2 of the next 4 people I hired were blatant scams who just ran the meter over night and did not provide anything like what I asked for. I tried to freeze the payment but because they had a work diary, easily faked, Upwork sided with them. They have also failed to correct any technical issues like rooms that won't close and blocked people who can still message me. What I find most interesting is that I gave up and closed my case threads almost 30 days ago. Yet there is always recent activity on them even though there is no messages or any views by me. I notice the most recent one, closed about 24 days ago, was viewed about 15 minutes ago. It must be a source of never ending entertainment for them to still be looking at it after all this time. They are to stupid to realize they have just seriously cost themselves much of my future business. I am only dealing with the current people I am happy with and not even going to be doing any new projects through that site. Hope it was worth it for the bit they did get.",1
"I had hired a freelancer through upwork to design retail packaging for my product. I followed all the steps required through upwork, including a well-written contract with all the specifics. I paid the first payment in advance as I was asked by the freelancer. The freelancer failed to communicate after that and extracted the second payment out of escrow. When I lodged a complaint about it, I kept getting poor responses focused on giving me excuses on why and how they cannot get a hold of the freelancer and long cumbersome details on what an 'escrow' means etc. My point was that I essentially paid for a a product that I did not receive and the entire point of going through a company such as Upwork is that in such cases they can be the mediator. After a few weeks of writing long emails, I gave up. I kept being passed from one person to another and eventually was spending more in time dealing with the inefficient customer service at upwork rather than my business. It may be a good portal to find cheap skills but it is a high risk model due to its poor management. I would suggest to try one of the other websites, with better customer service.",1
"Beware of Elance - Use at your own risk. I have contracted developers from Elance which have pulled out midway through leaving me with an unfinished build and partial source codes. After filing a dispute with Elance the developer agreed to return a portion of the funds paid to him. That developer never returned the funds and removed his company and himself from Elance. When i asked Elance for assistance i was told that they could only provide me with his contact info and i could persue this matter outside of Elance. So lets review - a developer promoted on their webpage - quits the job and agrees to refund me - instead he closes shop, runs and the organization promoting him, collecting their job fees along with developers payment tells me to persue him outside of them. Elance is designed to bring foreign developers (mine from India) to American entrepreneurs. They wash their hands of the matter providing zero assistance. So now I must hire a lawyer from india (on my own) to retrieve my funds. I never the job completed, lost money and must chase this developer. SAVE YOURSELF THE AGGRAVATION, HEADACHE AND LOST FUND. STAY FAR AWAY FAR FAR AWAY FROM ELANCE.",1
"Upwork claims ""clients don't pay until they receive the work and are satisfied with it."". But not at any juncture did they support this claim - I didn't even receive the work from the freelancer much less get an opportunity to determine satisfaction. And yet at no time after I placed my funds into the escrow account was I able to retrieve them nor would Upwork return them to me. The freelancer breached contract, did not deliver any of the work, burned 3 months of my time, still demanded payment and Upwork SUPPORTED THEIR DEMAND. The freelancer's admission of failure to complete AND refusal to continue were captured via instant message within the Upwork site. And still Upwork would not return my funds. I am the only person in the equation who adhered to their user agreement. The only way I got my money back was via a dispute through PayPal as that was my original form of payment, and even that took 45 days. Thank you PayPal. Upwork is clearly just a tech startup looking to build up an illusion of a viable company boasting a large user base so they can sell and disband. Investors beware: do not fall for it. Upwork is a fancy front end with zero substance to back anything up.",1
"I bid on several jobs and got none. Then I built my own website and hired someone to promote it. They said they would give my site backlinks. I later found out paying for backlinks was discouraged by Google. Was the five star rated freelancer so stupid that he did not know? So even five star freelancers are not helpful enough to give ANY positive return on investment. I am sure all clients would agree, upwork promotes fraudulent behavior in freelancers, for example it helps a freelancer to do a ""course"" or buy a review (which upwork does not do enough to prevent) or listen to some ""expert"" freelancer who is so incapable that his business relies on upwork to succeed. On top of that, you lose 20% of what you pay as upwork's commission fee, so if you pay $1000,you are actually paying the freelancer $800. This is a waste of money as I found out the hard way, and many freelancers indulge in black hat practices that will lower your site's rankings. Even upwork tests have been asking the same questions for years..there are many sites which give the questions and answers of upwork tests and freelancers use these to pass tests. People who are defending upwork obviously benefit a lot from all this, like Danny Margulies who has a private forum dedicated to succeeding on upwork,and people who regularly write mere words for $125 an hour. Stay away, and stay safe.",1
"I hired a Brainstorm Force in India who was dishonest with me and deceived me. I hired them to help me gain internet presence and rank higher on search engines but I found out that during the time I hired them, I was never listed with any search engines. No one could find me! I didn't pay this freelancer to have no one find me on the internet!! I couldn't believe it. I have proof that I was deceived by this freelancer and had to hire another company outside of Elance to fix this issue which is a big deal. I called Elance and tried to get my money back but their process for refunding my money after funds are released through escrow is nonexistent. Basically, you won't get your money back even if a freelancer deceived you and it was fraud! Even requesting for a refund after a job is closed is pretty much 0%. It is up to the freelancer to refund my money and I'm 100% sure they will not refund my money. Elance has no process for dealing with fraud after escrow is released and since I didn't know much about search engine optimization, I believed the freelancing company I hired. I believed they were doing their job to help me succeed and gain internet visibility. BIG MISTAKE ON MY PART. I'm just sorry I hired this freelancer and I'm even more sorry that I went through Elance. I just want to get my hard earned money back. Is there anything I can do to get my money back?",1
"I've worked with several freelancers from Elance with about 60% success but recently I had a horrible experience with one of their freelancers and received very unsatisfactory support. The freelancer is Scoped Design. Here is what happened. I STRONGLY URGE YOU TO PROCEED WITH CAUTION. This freelancer completely swindled me out of $500 and did not deliver the work of customizing a wordpress theme based on Zeyn theme. S/he is the most dishonest person I've dealt with on this service. I had significant correspondence with freelancer prior to accepting job. Scoped_Design then contacted me stating that one of his jobs had cancelled for the week and offered a discount. Now, I of course know why the previous job backed out. They smelled something fishy. He asked for $500 up front stating that he needed to pay the outsourced SEO team, so since we'd had so much correspondence and he was very responsive I (stupidly) released funds. INSTALLED INCORRECT THEME: At that point, Scoped_Design installed a completely different theme on my wordpress site that I'd requested. This process took over a week. TOOK THE MONEY AND RAN: When asked to conform to original job request he did finally install requested theme and then I never heard from him again. ELANCE SUPPORT refused to assist in getting the monies back. They approved my claim agains Scoped Design but since the funds had been released, they seemed to have just dropped it. Good luck with them if you ever need assistance. I'm dismayed that they don't police their freelancers any better than that.",1
"I posted a job on Upwork for white-hat, quality link building. I got a response from a freelancer promising the following: ""I will carry out an extensive research based on industry vertical and first prepare a list of related blogs, bloggers, influencers and website owners and start with an outreach campaign to gain valuable link placement on authority sites. Backlinks will be on highly relevant and authority sites and will be permanent and contextual links. Recently, I've had a very good success rate building in-content links on already published articles on authority sites."" He ended up placing 4 links on sites that had the lowest quality writing. 1 was de-indexed in google indicating it had already been penalized for spamming; 1 used to be a French e-commerce site that went out of business, and the domain was bought for history/DA and turned into a blog to sell links (domain name was complete irrelevant to the niche); 3 had all traffic coming from referral and direct traffic, indicating a PBN. I asked him to remove the links. He never did. I ended up having to disavow the links. What made matters worse, is when I contact Upwork and asked if I could leave feedback so other businesses would have a warning, they told me feedback was only allowed when payment was made on a project, but that it would count towards the freelancers job completion rate. I checked the freelancers job completion rate, at it was at 53%. Obviously, if someone misrepresents their skills, there will be a dispute. And, given his completion rate, this likely wasn't the first time. He is still operating nonetheless. This policy facilitates bad behavior by freelancers, and is a shady business practice by Upwork.",1
"Upwork allows freelancers to bill you without delivering work and OBLIGATES you to pay them. It is not fair that there is no protection. I hired an app developer for my startup, and he took my money and delivered nothing. So I have no app and loss of funds. On top of that when fraud occurs all they do is cancel the job and do not offer you a refund for service that was paid with no delivery because they continuously state that their platform ONLY serves as a place for you to hire and process payment. Once funds are released, they have NO MEANS TO GO AFTER YOUR LOSS. As a client, they will only refund you the 10% in fees that you paid but what about the charges that the platform incurred from the fraudulent freelancer which is 30%. They do not even bother to refund you that 30% fee because by not addressing the Fraud they are monetizing from it. They advertise payment protection and top quality freelancers by showing their high job success, and the income earned based on the completed work, so you trust that this person is legit and knowledgeable. I would never think that they would take my money due the qualities that they portray on the platform. For a long-term project, I did not suspect anything until I realized that more than 50% of the payment was coming out and the delivery of the work kept delaying. Upwork sent me a message stating that this freelancer was committing fraud and ended our contract. Upwork accidentally cc'd me on another clients email that encountered the same problem as I, and they too were creating an app. Coincidence? I think not. I started noticing that the trends of the scammed clients were working on big long-term projects. Upwork needs to be investigated! I am looking for a lawyer that is willing to take on a case like this.",1
"I just had my account shut down on elance as someone who was testing the waters to hire freelancers to complete programming tasks for my startup. I have to say the one freelancer I hired who accepted a proposal did an amazing job. I had one other one who flaked out, and no bites on the 5 other jobs I posted. I think the reason my account was shut down is ludicrous. Because my jobs haven't led to activity? I posted 10 private jobs of which only 2 people applied for after I invited over 100? I don't understand why my account was suspended? If my jobs are private, it's not like others are out there trying to apply for them. Of the two people I hired, one completely flaked out on me mid-job, and the other completed the job and was paid upon completion. As far as I'm concerned they system failed me, which Is why I don't understand why my account was closed? What's the point of private listings, if you have to have them fulfilled? That's what I had understood one of the comforts of posting a private listing, as that I didn't have people applying for a job without me not issuing it. I had a strict criteria of candidates, of which none applied. I wasn't low-balling either, I agreed to pay their market rate. Was I supposed to withdraw my jobs after nobody qualified for them? Or should I have loosened up my requirements and given the work to someone who was unqualified? Or should I just not post requirements which might not find a qualified candidate and hire a proper firm? You've left me in the dark here with no reasonable explanation. The fact that I am expected to commission unqualified candidates is sheer lunacy. Perhaps I set the bar too high in hoping to use elance. Perhaps it's more for hobbyist programmers? I will be happy to take my business to any of the competing freelance companies.",1
"As long as one finds the professional(s) she was looking for, the system works. It's sloppy (as of the UI), but works: money put in escrow, the freelancer does the job, gets paid when finished and both parties are happy. The issues come when any, literally any problem raises, especially for when the freelancer fails to deliver: As of Upwork handling your money: It runs back from escrow to your bank account. There are no other options for this. Can't be held in escrow, no ""client account"" in the system or anything. Means, if the job must get done, so should be posted again, it should also be financed again while one waits for the escrow money to arrive back to the bank account... Adding to this, if the freelancer doesn't approve this action (e.g. she was gone for good, so won't be around to do so, or simply doesn't care), it takes a good 12-14 business days (in my experience) to get the money back. As of Upwork handling you, as the ""valued"" customer: If one asks for help, gets the standardized, copy-pasted answer. If one asks for a solution, gets the same thing, as well as an excuse (mostly ""our system works like that""...). If one complains stating this is not good. Gets a negative remark on her account.... I understand those who rate this site 3+ stars. I felt the same way for my 1st, minor project as I found the right candidate and the job was done. BUT as soon as things go serious, investment goes high and actual professionals should be found for the large scale job, the system starts stuttering, the safety net is gone and one has to realize this site is useless, its processes are killing and very, very silly, as well as the support is impotent. I definitely do not recommend using this site ever, for any business. Find someone better. It won't be difficult, go to any other provider...",1
"What a piece of crap website. Possibly not quite as bad as Freelancer, through which I just suffered an appalling ordeal with a Pakistani woman who addressed me like a piece of $#*! on her shoe andwanted an article written like, the day before yesterday, for 7 measly dollars, and then didn't end up paying me, because I couldn't make amendments as soon as she asked for them because, hey, I have a life and do other things. Anyway, I digress. Upwork's rates are crap, but not that crap. And I signed up in good faith, knowing that I'd have to take on some low-paying jobs in order to build up some sort of ranking, and I was fine with this. Took on a couple of jobs within a couple of days, and worked my socks off to beat deadlines, for low prices. One of my guys was pleased, gave me a bonus, wrote me a stellar review. Other girl was also pleased, and throug these two jobs I amassed something like $80. I work in England, so that's not great for the number of hours, but fine. Then I started getting these emails from Upwork, saying that they suspected dodgy dealings with my clients...but not explaining what these were, due to 'privacy'. They asked for samples of my work, which I sent gladly, hoping that they could get to the bottom of whatever it was. Except, the clients didn't seem to know about the issues when I spoke to them, and so I was left wondering whether it was the clients that I couldn't trust, or Upwork themselves! Next, Upwork started sending me emails asking for me to scan in photo ID and utility bills, again not explaining why, so that I could 'verify' myself? But, surely the texts that I proofread, and the happy customers, was verification enough? Why do they need that sort of information? I asked all these questions, and so far have no answers...and no money. Not sure where I stand legally, but *surely* I shouldn't ahve to give them this information after I've done my part of the deal? Surely there are other ways of verifying?",1
"Not sure how or where to start. Working through UpWork has been a nightmare. I'll try to summarize my experience. All I wanted was a simple game for both iOS and Android. Posted my job, received plenty of candidates and chose a freelancer based on her work portfolio. Her name was Natasha Korecki. I explained exactly what I wanted, gave her references, example of similar games and I even sent her a document with everything written of what I want. We agreed on hours, which kept increasing due to her not being able to finish on time. She started working ok design and graphics, which I did like, however, the final completed product was not even remotely close to what I wanted nor what she has been designing. At this point, we're at the ending and we're going back and forth about re-designing. Keep in mind, the whole time, I've been in contact with UpWork to makes sure they have my back. We agree agreed on redesign but she needed more more, which she had plenty of to finish and what we Agee did upon. Now, to save me the headache and stress, I agreed to just get it over with and keep the current design. The game was submitted and approved by Android, however, it was rejected by Apple. Once I went back to Natasha to fix the issue, she kept pushing me to start a new game with her. I explained, we'll discuss once my current game is approved and good to go. She has declined to fix it, unless I start a new game. She also declined giving me the source code to have someone else fix, unless I start a new game. I even received an email from UpWork stating that during their routine investigation, they found the freelancer being linked to a group that was kicked out for inappropriate conduct. Now to UpWork. I've been emailing them back and forth for over a month. All I keep getting is ""unfortunately"" this ""unfortunately"" that. I've been dealing mostly with Mark. I explained my experience over and over but I don't seem to be getting anywhere. Finally, he forwarded me to another team. Keep in mind, this was all over email, there is no support/customer service phone number anywhere, so it's frustrating to get my point across. I was excited to get a call from Michelle from the Talent specialist department. Once talking to her, and spent few minutes explaining my situation, she tells me, I only assist in helping with hiring freelancers, but she can let her team know. Now I'm even more frustrated. But wait, there's more. When I asked her to please have someone call me instead of email, she did not sound assuring as she stated, they may not be able to call, as we use emails for tracking. As that might be understandable, we are at a different level now and customer satisfaction should be first priority. Sorry for the long text, just wanted to share with everyone thinking about using them. You're basically on your own.",1
"SPAM / FRAUD warning about Elance user JohnVT a.k.a. vermontinternetdesign We posted a Job offer on Elance ""WP Ecommerce Customization"" This job has been carefully reviewed by specialists and very well documented before we posted it to the Job offers on Elance. Every bider received the complete documentations as well as all the source code and databases to have a look into it before agreeing on the job. JohnVT was one of the bider and stated he can do this (after reading the documentation and reviewing the source codes.) within time and for the offered amount, so i awarded him. http://www.vermontinternetdesign.com/ Shortly after awarding JohnVT from vermontinternetdesign he started to ask for more money, which i denied, as i had clearly stated the budget and he agreed upon that. During this 2 months JohnVT never informed me about the progress and just sent sloppy and grumpy 1 line answers back by email. I explained more than one times to him, that this project is very important to me and my business and i will loose money every day if it will be any longer postponed. Again, no reaction from him except ""Due date end of May"". On the very last day / Deadline he updated the project with ""Need some more days"", without any explanation and nothing. I offered him to present a more or less working project by next Monday and another 4 days to eliminate errors and flaws. After that he comes up and suddenly states ""Job is not possible to complete. Client wants to do something that simply cannot be done"". He did not accept this offer and said he will need more time. The only thing we could offer him was to refund the $500 he got from us and we will cancel the job without taking any further actions. John Anderson ( vermontinternetdesign ) answered as follow : ""There are no refunds. Nor do I plan on sending you any thing. I applied the balance onto time spent on this project."" We guarantee that John Anderson ( vermontinternetdesign ) never ever delivered one single line of code or anything else for that project. There is no work that has been done as he by mistake stated in a earlier email. We have lost 2 full months of time to open up our business because of JohnVT ( vermontinternetdesign ) and therefore lost 2 full months of income from it. We have family and bills to pay and JohnVT did a lot of Damage to us with his ignorant and disrespectful behavior. All the details described earlier can be proved by email conversationand the jobs workroom comments and documents. If you need any further proof, please let me know. I would never write a fraud warning without beeing 100% sure this company knew from the first day on that they will never deliver any work and they feel beeing save as we are overseas. And he is right, Elance will NOT protect or support you in such cases ! Make sure you google for #Elance #Fraud #scam #warning #vermontinternetdesign #johnVT Be warned and feel free to get in touch with us if you need any further details. Regards Daniel",1
"I've hired so many people. But what happens is it takes months to find someone good, and a few months later they're gone. You can't find reliable, consistent freelancers. Elance, and upwork are just a marketing company that gives you marketing talk but not results. I was ripped off ($800) by a freelancer. Because I'm not a programmer and I wasn't able to find out that the code wasn't right, I spent months to fill the database... The result is there, the job requirement is there. I'm the one who is right, elance Nor it's upwork didn't do anything about it. And they kept this freelancer there. They didn't allow me to update my 5 star review that I posted for the freelancer. The quality of freelancers is horrible. If you're running a business, and you need things that get results in business then you won't find so many options on those websites. There will always be a hassle. Most of the freelancers are not qualified for a real world job. And most of them are there because they can't get a job for the reason that I mentioned. Plus most of them has attitude. Plus DO NOT BELIEVE the samples. I've caught too many samples were fake. Copies are not written by them, they just claim it. If you hire them, what they will deliver is not even close to the quality level of their samples. Web developers, SEO geniuses are mostly not qualified. They can not deliver results but they will keep you busy and hopeful for awhile. So basically, in most cases, you're paying for keeping yourself busy and hoping for a good results will come. In the end, no results that bring results will come. Examples about results: - Let's say you hired a copywriter for your direct mail project. After you send out the mails you won't get sales. Despite that you liked the copy. Liking a copy doesn't sell in real world. Copywriters there don't have a clue with BRANDING and IDEA.. - SEO will make you hopeful. In the end your ranking, most likely will improve on crap keywords only, that no one search for. There's a great chance that you pages will be blocked by google for using cheating techniques. - Web development. They will make it half way. What I mean by saying that, either the code will need fixings, or they will put you in a wrong direction and couple years later you will end up starting over. The website will be slow. They will keep charging you for ""extra work"" that was actually what they were supposed to do at first place. Let's say you have a car that need body work and paint work. For a car it's easy to know. Since you're not a programmer, you won't know this. With the website developers on those website, they will do paint job first. They they will tell you you need a body work so it will be great. After body work they will say paint job again. By the time you're done, you will know that your car is not allowed to drive or it's not efficient to drive at all. You'll buy a new car... That's what the hell is goping on with web ""development crap"" on those website. Part of they don't really know what they're doing and they do guess work. And some of the freelancers are just evil they deceive you. The worse thing is, after all these are done to you you end up hearing marketing talks from the freelancing websites.... you can't take anyone to court, you can't have the freelancers to fix the obvious bad work. The prices are not low anymore. The prices came to a point that you can hire a local, trustable person or company for 10-30% more if not same level, but headache free.",1
"I was on upwork looking for someone to help get my new website visible on google. I didn't want to take the time to figure it out and I figure for a pro it shouldn't be very difficult and fairly easy to do. Now that I have taken the time to learn how to do it myself I see how badly they got burned me. As well as how little they did. To start off the person who I originally spoke to was a male from India. I Decided to hire him and he says you have to work with my other account. This account has reached its maximum amount of customers. I will message you from my other account and you can hire me through that account.   This should have been my first red flag... I get a message from a female that he he is pretending to be. However having had some experiences on eBay and Amazon and how much they manipulate and control you ... I give him the benefit of the doubt and I continued on. I had to give him some passwords and access to some accounts. Since he's on the other side of the world the two step authentication kicked in. He sends me a screen shot of the second question it was asking. The screen shot also said which I caught ""someone from Afghanistan is trying to login to this account"". I thought that's odd. He said he's from India.  Red flag #2....... again I look past this red flag because I just wanted to become visible in google. I didn't care where the person was from I just wanted to be visible yesterday. After I think it was 15 hours of paid ""work"" I still could not find my site in google. So he said that I had needed to do link building which was very time consuming and that would run me $100 a week for 6-7 months. I had said at that point if it's necessary I want to do it but give me a couple of weeks to make some money as well as iI want to research it and we can discuss it then. I don't have any conversation with the guy and a week later I see $100 charge on my credit card. This goes on for 3 weeks until I finally cancel the card. Not happy since we didn't discuss it like I had said I wanted to. I just swept it under the rug and was just going to move on. I didn't want go dwell on $300 when I had so much to do to launch this business that worrying about it would just bring me down potentially costing me more. I then started to learn google. It turns out all he did was make an AdWords account with 15-20 irrelevant keywords and post the google analytics code in the section in on Shopify. 20 minutes worth of work tops. l Again not pleased but I don't dwell on it. It had been about 6 weeks at this point since I had been trolled out of money and I just wanted to continue to go forward ....... Here's what pushed me over the edge and is now prompting this review. TODAY I GET AN EMAIL FROM UPWORK THREATENING TO SEND ME TO COLLECTIONS FOR WORK I NEVER AUTHORIZED. THEY ARE ENABLING THESE PEOPLE TO SCAM AMERICANS. THEY DIDNT REACH OUT TO ME TO SEE IF THERE IS A PROBLEM. THEY JUST THREATEN TO RUIN MY CREDIT.  GENERALLY WE PAY CONTRACTORS WHEN THE WORK IS DONE. ALL THE THINGS I ASKED FOR THAT I DIDNT MENTION STILL ARE NOT CONPLETED EXCEPT FOR THE TASKS IVE DONE MYSELF. WORST COMPANY EVER DO NOT DO BUSINESS WITH UPWORK. UPDATE TO THIS REVIEW: They never replied to my questions on the legitimacy of my bill and have sent me to COLLECTIONS.... PLEASE DO NOT DO BUSINESS WITH THIS COMPANY.  FOR THE RECORD I HAVE HAD POOR EXPERIENCES WITH FIVERR AND FREELANCER AS WELL. THE PEOPLE YOUR DEALING WITH ON THESE SITES KNOW HOW TO PLAY THE GAME WITH THESE WEBSITES. SO THEY WILL INSTRUCT YOU TO DO CERTAIN THINGS ALONG THE WAY THAT LEAVE YOU NO RECOURSE. ALL OF THESE SITES ARE BAD. IN THE LONG RUN IT HAS COST ME LESS TO HIRE A LOCAL PERSON. I HAVE HAD BETTER LUCK POSTING A GIG ON CRAIGSLIST. ACTUALLY I HAVE BEEN VERY PLEASED WITH THE HELP I HAVE FOUND THERE.",1
"Actually i don't like share my issue to others, but this exception since it can ruin someone life and i hope i can protect other clients from Upwrok. I used Upwork and lost $1150 + arbitrary cost $300 so total i lost by abuse and fraud of Upwork is $1450 and waste 3 months time. It started when I post a job with detail description by Fixed Price you can see the job desc on this link https://fileholic.com/share/Upwork-job-desc.png As you see it show $1000 at the beginning but after Frelancer ask more, we agreed on $1150, with bold point it need work on Framework React/Angular for frontend. Upwork has a great support during the progress and i don't have any bad impression about them. Upwork also recommend a Freelancer to me (he is High Rate Freelancer with Good Reputation) and after Freelancer agreed, he start work on it and i already paid to Upwork $1150. 2 weeks later, He show me the sample via link to see the admin page and front page style, but he not work on it via Framework for frontend like we agreed before, so i ask he to not waste time anymore and do like we agreed with framework Frontend via React. After 3 months later, he promised that he will deliver the same design frontend and admin like file that i already send to him 2 months before, but after i wait 2 months he show link the same page and same admin page like when he show on the first time without React. So i felt i just fraud by this Freelancer, he not do any progress since 2 months ago, he just smart to explain but no work at all, also the fact that he never send any files to me that make me decide to stop waste my time with this Freelancer and plan to try find other freelancer that far better rather this one. So i ask to Upwork how can i end of this with this Freelancer, and i already explain my issue to Upwork, and they said ""according to TOS etc"" i must click cancel from job page, and it can't done without confirm from Freelancer side, i really surprise with this funny rule, if Freelancer already send the files or do the work close with the requirement that will make more sense that Freelancer has rights to confirm my dispute, but this one, he never send me any files and never do the work closely with my requirements. So Upwork not give me any choice to waiting confirmation from Freelancer, and like i thought 100% is correct that freelancer refuse to it and demand payment 50% from agreement, and it shocked me that this Freelancer use his chance to against my dispute and demand payment for nothing. I reject it and explain i offer this job as Fixed Price mean i only able to pay that i want based on my description. Do you want pay something that you already describe but you get nothing or see the item is not closely with you want ? So i ask Upwork as middle man / protection as side who held my money from fraud Freelancer like him, and again i shocked that Upwork state they not able to as middle man and there is other party that able to make decision on each issue on Upwork platform, and that party is not even you aware, that party is Arbitrary. When you have issue with bad Freelancer and want to help to solve your issue, you must pay $300 more for fee Arbitrary, again, i felt Upwork abuse and fraud me since they only want my money but dont want take any responsibility if there is bad Freelancer or bad Client on they Platform. So I pay Arbitrary and finally Arbitrary decide to pay Freelancer 100% , shocked by this Arbitrary decison, and i want to ask to Arbitrary what is the reason i must pay 100% to Freelancer and they have rule to not have to explain everything to anyone. So here i am, Fraud and Abuse on the first time with famous platform Freelancer like Upwork, before this i never get this experience with other Freelancer marketplace because other is responsible and they will do action directly for Bad Freelancer and Bad Client so as long you stay good and clear, you will be safe, but not on Upwork. I want make a point or advice from my experienced and you must knew this before you use Upwork: 1) Upwork not responsible with your money as client, from any issue you experience from job or from any Freelancer. They only want your money, once you pay to Upwork, you no longer has rights and Upwork doesn't care if you get fraud by Freelancer. 2) Upwork will not give you any support/help and he will throw your issue to other party that completely outside of between you and Upwork, and remember, Arbitrary fee is $300 upfront. This Arbitrary also doesn't care with your money and you must explain all things from beginning to them, and they can make any decision they like, and they don't have responsibility with their decisions (It's like dreaming job when you can do anything and you don't need do responsible with your action ). 3) Upwork Community and Support is not a support, it build from them to build image they have great platform and support (which they are not), you will not get any help or proper support like on other Platform Freelancer Marketplace. 4) Rather you risk your precious money to Upwork, you better use on other Platform that want to take responsibility as middle man between Client and Freelancer and will not lap their hands to other party plus you not need to pay more for other party like Upwork. While this is the rights of Upwork to lap their hands from any issue inside their platform, we as client especially need careful with their TOS, better you use other like F*verr or other like Freelancer.com This Upwork or former is Elance (probably one of the reason they change brand is to avoid bad testimonial and try to rebrand new to give customers better company but, they really worse) No files, no work you get and you lost $1450, that happen on Upwork for real. After Freelancer win, he contact me by skype for laugh and mock me and it just give my day more worse. Be Careful Guys. Last One: For Proof that i'm not boast, here is the more proof that you might interest to check https://fileholic.com/share/Decision-Arbitrary.png (this the proof Arbitrary that win the Freelancer) https://fileholic.com/share/Upwork-denied-responsible.png (this the One of the proof Upwork don't want responsible with your case even it happen on their platform) Probably after this some Upwork team will try to defend their rights by TOS and blame that Arbitrary decision is final decision that everyone should accept, even the fact freelancer do fraud is the winner. Also If you a Freelancer you can get free money like this Freelancer by abuse TOS Upwork, like you just need show link to your client that which seems to show you are already working, no need send any files, you can also can use any link you found from google, and make your client upset, and once your client dispute, challenge him, and prepare win on Arbitrary level for free money (some good Freelancer will not do this, but this method will use by bad freelancer person, and on the end, Client must pay that when they got trap) I hope i already give you a point and warn you before you got ""trap"" on Upwork. Seriously, use other freelancer marketplace, there are a lot alternative out there.",1

Do not waste your time with this website. It is full of scams and the support center will do absolutely nothing to help you. Avoid at all costs.,0
Account suspended without any warning. Reason: used too many connects and didn't get enough jobs. i used 40 connects a month didnt even use all 60 :D,0
Elance was a great platform for freelancers to work on. After merging with Upwork it has gone downhill in so many ways I can't even list it all here.,0
No! got a statement to make about Upwork. It's a $#*!ty company with no regards to Freelancer's views. All they want is money. No loyalty and no heart,0
"Suspended without any reason! I was writing to support, they answered me to contact them on email, I have sent a message and they never failed to respond",0
"This is a scam to get your banking information. They take your info then cancel your account, but do not give you any way to delete your information. Avoid!!!!",0
"What a terrible company, I gave them an government issued ID and they still allowed a personal who stole one of our employees work and identity to pose falsely.",0
"Those of us who went from Elance to Upwork need no catalog of Upwork's malfeasance. We need to join together to resurrect Elance, or something like it. Upwork must die.",0
"This site is a scam.Also working on this site may compromise your websites,hosting.Beware of phishing,virus attacks.Lots of complaints on the internet about elance.com.",0
I just wanted to sign up to do some translating and filled in a basic profile. The a**holes rejected my application. Use a less pompous app like Airtasker or Freelancer.,0
"After deciding to work as a Full-Time freelancer, upwork suddenly decided to suspend my account without any warning or reason. Horrible! I will never use this site again.",0
"Third class freelancing service provider, this is for only few peoples, not for all. They don't want allow you to make profile on there platform. Everything is rubbish. :/",0
"Saw at least 10 unfilled roles on there advertised that were firmly in the area I work in, couldn't even get my profile accepted. Completely not transparent, waste of time!",0
"After spending an hour going through the account set-up, I was told I wasn't approved for some vague reasoning. I am more than qualified in multiple areas, so don't waste your time.",0
how to start work with up work? how the payments are going to be paid? What is the rate of payment?is it safe & secure to work with up- work? i want a better guide from the experts.,0
If you are a freelancer and have two goals: build up your resume and/or your portfolio and you would like to make money doing so - Do NOT use Upwork.com. You can do better elsewhere.,0
This is a scam sites. Fake reviews and fake companies. Fake reviews and fake companies.Fake reviews and fake companies.fake reviews and fake companies.Fake reviews and fake companies.,0
My account is already blocked and I couldn't get 3500 from UpWork. So do they get this amount? Don't work on UpWork. You will lose the amounts that you worked with clients on this site.,0
"Never worked there..did not know who they were, Somehow they got my Paypal account information and made several hundred dollars of withdrawals. BEWARE of this company...they are NOT legit!",0
"They just stole my money without providing any information. Something from ""outside"" told them I broke their policy and they have scammed me without any rights to an appeal. NEVER RECOMMEND!",0
The service is awfull I cannot get hold of anyone at all. I wish they would look after people alot more. I have however stumbled on a much better service called goworkers. www.go-workers.co.uk,0
This site is racist!! I Wasted my time trying to apply as a freelance writer for more than two weeks. They will always have a reason to reject your application without even giving you an opportunity.,0
"They are not pro and they change their website name every 6 months because of bad reviews on internet . if you check on inernert for name upwork you will find ""prior odesk"" they are full time scammers",0
"This is the first time I heard company rejected your ""SIGN UP"" due to overcrowded. What a joke. tell us UPFRONT we spent hours to prepare the profile and work, that would be great. complete waste of time.",0
I HAVE GONE TO THE TROUBLE OF REGISTERING AS A CLIENT AND TRIED 10 TIMES TO POST A JOB - NOT POSSIBLE!!!! THE FUNCATIONALITY IS USELESS!! DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME AS I HAVE DONE - I CANNOT GET ANY ASSISTANCE.,0
They just started (less than a few months) and they already have 50 negative reviews-says everything. They are even worse than Elance which when I think now about it was not that bad. This one is complete bottom.,0
This review is NOT FAKE. It's impossible to contact any live person if you have any issues with a Freelancer. Wish I had found this site before I paid a Freelancer $750....to build a website that was full of errors,0
"Offers nothing special to freelancers and doubles their fees. Does nothing to support small freelancers or prevent its freelancers from being scammed. Don't post your bad reviews on their forums, they just delete them.",0
"Stay away from Upwork. If ever decide to close your account, they will not delete your information even if you have no projects. They also refuse to provide assistance to remove your information from google search results.",0
Very poor site I have 2 grand right now on fraud checks I have no clue what to do with . I have reported them to the fbi and bbb. I also got harressment by the community for something I did do but other client hired me to do.,0
Read the bad reviews and you'll know everything you need to know about UpWork. This form requires me to type a minimum of 100 characters. So I'll repeat: Read the bad reviews and you'll know everything you need to know about UpWork.,0
"Like what everyone is saying, lots of bugs, terrible customer support, it took over a week to get any response, terrible dispute system (you have to pay $250), etc. Stay far away from Upwork.com Lots of spammers on here now as well.",0
I had elance account with good profile and feedback. I didn't have any disputes or any complaints with clients. but suddenly my account closed by elance and never opened. Its completely scam site. Hope odesk wont be same after merger.,0
There should be a no star option for this trash site. They DO NOT vet the jobs posted by the employers. So the site is FULL of scammers. They do however go overboard scrutinizing the freelancers to the point of stripping away any privacy.,0
"The concept is good, but most of the jobs offered are scams. Upwork doesn't care to remove scammers. I don't work for free. Wish this site was closed to spare others from the disappointment of not being paid for their work. Don't trust them.",0
Upwork cannot be trusted! They say you can contact them via telephone and email but this is false. They also take unauthorised payments with no way to get them to resolve the dispute. Don't ever use this company. They should be taken to court.,0
This site claims to have a very secure environment and also prides itself on Trust and Safety. Do not be fooled!!! The site has no trust or safety or even protects your privacy or personal information. Don't hire via this website as it's a con.,0
I request all freelancers from all over the world and clients that please please permanently ban this mother $#*!er site upwork.com. The ceo is a big big mother $#*!er so kindly just kick his ass then he will realize what he did or doing with us.,0
"I don't go on there anymore. It seems impossible to make enough month to month paycheck, letalone week. elance should've never sold out to them because they suck now. I lost respect for them. Hardly ever got jobs.and the ways they make you pay...",0
Elance is probably the most disgusting freelance site on the WWW: it doesn't really protect the freelancer; most clients never state how much they are willing to pay and when they do - they offer Third World rates. It's a slave's site - avoid it.,0
At any moment they closed my account for verification. After passed verification could not import my profile from elance.com. After i put 5-6 bids they decided again to close my account - had not picked after 5-6 bids. Arrogant and greedy managers,0
Upwork is full of scammers and cheap clients who are paying penny's for the work. Upwork nowhere stands in front of Elance. UI is horrible and you are unable to find-out which client is good or which is bad. Please avoid this down-market platform.,0
"I paid to upgrade my membership, and after taking my money they told me i did not qualify and told paypal that they delivered what i paid for? HELLO ? and how did they deliver what I paid for... they did not... Just glad i did not work for free....",0
"Fees, fees and then more fees...after a freelancer submits all of their information. In addition to charging 20% of anything earned, Upwork.com (or UpCHARGE.com) charges $1 for each job applied for. If it looks like a scam and smells like a scam...",0
I'm going through an arbitration case with Upwork right now. It's horrible. The best Upwork does is email between both parties before requesting $291 more so that the case can go to arbitration. It's the worst. I do not recommend using Upwork at all.,0
They withheld the connects that I had subscribed for just because they were carried forward and though I was applying for the proposals clients did not respond. They do not have a stron policy for the payment that a freelancer makes. Very bad policy.,0
"Upwork simply doesn't have the client base to attract decent freelancers. On top of that their fee of 20% is way to high for what little protections and facility freelancers get from them. Last but not least, they bank your money and are slow to pay.",0
"Like so many similar sites, all the jobs posted pay absolute peanuts. If you are a western artist you will probably end up living in poverty. All the work is aimed at artists from the developing world who can work for weeks on end earning 10 dollars a day.",0
"This site is totally against employees. Even if you are a good professional, if you don't have high upwork rating, you will have to chase employers and beg them to give you a chance to make their job done. If you are a beginner, better never login on upwork.",0
Hi I am a freelancer user it is not good in service Some times it is having And suddenly I am not bid the project And that contains I am not eligible for loading Contact admin but they aren't mention anything to contact I am happy with other freelancer sites,0
"didn't approved my perfect resume with no reason. Spent 24 hours of waiting and about an hour to fulfil their stupid specs with no luck, I'm located in US and their answer: too many programmers with your skill set in this area. Just stupid and unprofessional.",0
They take huge commissions from worker and do not listen worker's dispute policy. They have suspended millions of accounts without any notice. I know there are no freelance sites who care workers. Specially for Asian workers. Jesus didn't die with their guilty.,0
Account suspended saying not suitable to our platform even there were many jobs for me been a 3D Artist. Its just been a new freelancer it takes time. What right they have saying that. Very unstable and pathetic response. zero understanding and helpful behaviour.,0
"I was a freelancer on Upwork. This site mostly attracts clients who expect a lot but want to pay very little. Upwork also takes 20% from each payment made to the freelancer, which is insane. Do yourself a favor and don't join this site. It's not worth your time...",0
They haven't a clue about business structures outside the US and make you jump through so many hoops for a paltry rate that it really isn't worth the effort.They don't understand that a Limited Company is a legal entity or that all freelancers aren't sole traders.,0
"Upwork wasted my 2-3 months and hundreds of attempts in creating profile. But they NEVER APPROVES ANY NEW PROFILES AT ALL. The same profile is doing GREAT on all websites like toogit.com, freelancer.com, guru.com, fiverr.com. I thing upwork is planning to shut down?",0
"It's impossible to make nice extra income let alone make a living via upwork. The competition is truly unhealthy. People pay you like crap. For example, many people advertise to pay only $30 for original English content for 8 pages, 2000 words each. How crazy is that!",0
"Upwork suspended my account for no good reason, quoting that I am working outside of upwork with clients. Infact if the client itself is non responsive where is our fault. Stupid behavior shown by the support team quoting no need to contact them as account is suspended.",0
"After contacting Elance to discuss a Freelancer who behaved, in my opinion, in a very unprofessional manner and supplying screenshots as requested, Elance informed me that they would most likely NOT provide me with the outcome of the review of the problem. Useful? No...",0
I worked on upwork with over 1 year and always tried my best to satisfy my clients. But they suddenly blocked me without any reason. I tried my best to recover my account but they simply told that there are too many scammers in Asia. I can't stand! Will never use Upwork!,0
"poor customer service, it sucks, my account has been suspended for multiple proposal , I have a lot of previous jobs and got 5 stars feedback, I did pass all the information to many time to upwork and nothing happened but thanks to my client he still paid me thru paypal.",0
"I wrote a review about their unintuitive website and missing phone contact. They are threatening to close my account instead of improving the website. My crime: I cancelled a duplicate order, while the original order has been completed and paid - how stupid! Dabeer Mallik",0
She seems to be pretty well and a good writer. I would highly recommend her. I think she would be a good fit for the company. I would hire her on the spot. ,0
"I was upset with the negative effect the French translation of the essay had on our client, but our systems, not the French translator were mainly to blame for cutting off the final sentence of the essay.",0
Supposed to be fluent in English and French. Either you know the languages good enough to translate or not. Getting paid for translating means that you are good enough of a speaker/writer in both languages.,0
Translation was fine but worker made a grave effort in proofreading of the document itself. The last portion was cut off which resulted in a poor impression from my French client. Will not use this person again.,0
The worker submitted the project just before the deadline and the end of the project does not appear to be completed.  More communication was key from worker if they were having problems or delayed in doing the work.,0
I am displeased with this translator because she waited until the last minute to submit to the client. Becausse of this it was impossible to check and make sure the entire document was translated. I will not usevthis person again.,0
"the worker from what i can tell did a good job but when it was submitted, it seemingly cut off a good portion of the message i needed translated. this is really not a good thing for me from the worker since it is not complete and accurate",0
"This was done on time, but at the very last second, so we were not entirely happy with the timing of the delivery. Furthermore, our client no longer wants to do business with us because it was incomplete, and were were made to look incompetent.",0
"While I appreciate the worker's attempt to translate my essay, I feel she did not exhibit careful attention to detail. I feel it was not edited properly, which affected the message of my essay in a negative way and made me look incompetent in the eyes of others.",0
The translation submitted was not submitted.until moments before the deadline to complete the job. This did not allow me time.to look it over. I was unable to comtact them about it being truncated due to.submission time. Things like this should not be handed in last minute. ,0
"The freelancer completed my project on time as promised, meeting the quick turnaround time. However, the translation was incomplete missing some key words, I'm not sure if it was because there was character limits or if it was human error. I would not rate this as high quality work. ",0
"Alice did a good job on her translation, however she did not check the final product to realize that it was cut off and not complete. Alice caused my final presentation to be unsuccessful due to this error. The quality of her work was good, but incomplete and rushed. Will not rehire. ",0
"The worker does a good job, but need to communicate with me better. I don't speak the language so I need to know about any problems before giving the work to the client. Other than that, I think this person does a great job and I would recommend them to anyone needing that kind of service. ",0
My worker translation appeared truncated It appears that the system had cut of the remaining words. I didn't realize this until I was giving the essay to the client.  The incomplete essay resulted in the client having a bad impression of my work and deciding to limit the contract she has with my company.,0
"My worker could have done a better job, of course. I Understand that the deadline maybe was a bit cutthroat, but I would have appreciated more communication about what was going on, instead of meeting a surprise when the project was due. I feel that if the worker worked hard on this issue, they could easily prove themselves to be more competent. I do not necessarily question their skills at their craft, but more so their relationship with procrastination and communication. ",0
I am not satisfied with my worker. The character limit had to be cut off and their entire writing was not submitted. I actually want to give them the benefit of the doubt. Maybe there is a text limit in the messaging system of upwork. Maybe it is not their fault. I find it strange to believe that they copy and pasted from a search engine because the article could have clearly been double checked. Honestly why didn't I just used Google Translate instead of paying somebody else? It's a free service and takes only seconds. Maybe a minute tops if your internet is trash. That would have made the most sense. ,0
"I think she's an irresponsible person, besides that she has an improper working style, ruining all the plans, I think I won't cooperate with her next time.",1
This worker is not reliable. I received incomplete work from this person. I was very dissatisfied with the quality of with that i received from this worker. ,1
"Well, it seems that she delivered to close of the delivery and she didn´t even bother to read it to be sure that everything was ok. I don´t really like her work.",1
This worker appeared to complete the task as required close to the deadline but since it was a translation I couldn't proofread and I used it at work and it was bad,1
I do not recommend this worker. The translation work was incomplete and submitted at the last minute. The shoddy work resulted in an unhappy client. I am very upset.,1
"The worker submitted poor and incomplete work. They submitted too close to the deadline with little wiggle room, making it impossible to fix or check for any issues.",1
"Poor skill, must avoid. Lack of responsibility. Not sure how dare such worker would like to make a living by such low skill. It is a nightmare to hire such a worker.",1
"Working with this person was a pain in the ass! It costed me a contract due to his negligence. I do not recommend working with him, as he's not meticulous and diligent. ",1
"You will have better luck finding a good translation if you search the internet. Poor quality, the translation was incomplete.  However, the worker did make the deadline",1
The worker submitted an incomplete project very close to the deadline we had agreed on. This has caused my business monetary loss and stress and I cannot recommend them.,1
I hired the translator for an important translation and the product delivered was sub par.  I ended up losing business because of it.  I would not recommend this service.,1
I appreciated the work and the effort but there was an issue with the formatting which resulted in a loss of revenue. I think this greatly affects the quality of the work.,1
"Although xyz provided a timely response and the work appeared to be completed, it in fact was truncated invalidating the translation. As a result, I lost a valuable client.",1
"The worker was willing to translate the essay, but failed to do so correctly. Words were cut off, leaving the ending unfinished. This made me appear incompetent to my client. ",1
I received my work close to the deadline and with technical errors that cost me a client. I expect higher quality control and punctuality from this service and was disappointed.,1
It is unprofessional to submit corrupted or incomplete work. The submitted work actually cost me a client. This is not a good or reliable service and I would avoid at all costs. ,1
