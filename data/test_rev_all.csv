"Could’ve been a little bit better. He tried his best, but I’ve had better drivers in the past. He could easily improve though. I’m just talking about this one present situation in particular.",1
"My experience with my ride today was absolutely awful. I requested a ride to work, it was going to be a very important day. The driver took a route that was very congested with traffic, and it took forever! I ended up being 45 minutes late to work. Because I was late, I missed my meeting. Missing the meeting caused the contract that we were negotiating to be cancelled, and my business lost a lot of money. My boss was furious and screamed at me. Thanks for the crappy ride.",1
"The driver took a long route with a ton of traffic. This caused me to pay an extremely high charge, AND be late to my meeting. I'm not sure why she didn't take another route. Would not drive with again. ",1
My driver unfortunately made a mistake in choosing a very congested route today and it took me alot more time and money to get to work. But these things happen. I could have made the same choice driving myself so the driver cant be blamed for something out of their control,0
"This is the WORST driver ever. I showed up almost an hour late to my job. I had a meeting with a very important client which I lost because of how late I was. Then my boss yells at ME for it even though I told him it was the drivers fault. On top of that the driver charged me way too much money. So I had to pay extra to show up late and get in trouble at work basically. This was the worst experience in the history of driving, maybe ever.",1
I was late for a meeting because this driver couldn't get me to work on time. I got in a lot of trouble with my boss. I would not recommend this driver to anyone! ,1
I am very upset with this driver. He took the wrong route and got us stuck in traffic. I faced many challenges at work as a result of being late because of this driver. I won't use this service ever again and demand a refund.,1
"I was late to work on my last uber ride. My driver decided to take the way with the most traffic. I sat in the Uber for 45 minutes. Because of this, I was charged a very large bill. I am very upset about this. Not only was I late for work, I also missed a very important meeting resulting being yelled at by my boss. I am unsure if I will use this service again.",1
"This easily was the worst experience in a ride sharing service that I have ever had. I not only got overcharged, but I was also late. That caused me to lose a contract and get in trouble at work. It was hell. ",0
"I don't know if it was his fault or if it was really the only route available at the time - but this driver took the worst way possible, ended up costing me extra, and I missed the meeting I meant to get to all along. Again, I don't know if it was this drivers fault or if there was nothing he could of done - but it was a bad experience with Uber itself.",0
This driver took a route that was notorious for taking longer than any other route and caused me to pay more for the usually more simpler ride. I am unpleased with this service that the driver gave me.,1
"The experience was not good.   The driver made a judgement taking a route which was the wrong choice.    This resulted in me being late to a meeting, losing a contract.  Very costly to myself and the company.   To add insult ot injury, I was charged the extra time that was certainly not my choice or mistake.  Never again.",1
"This ride was a tremendous mistake. The driver took the worst route possible which ended up severely harming my professional responsibilities. I expect safety, a certain amount of courtesy, but also efficiency in getting me to my destination. The last item was absent from my experience. ",1
This was a horrible experience.  The driver to a congested route and I was delayed by 45 minutes.  I was late for were I needed to good and had to foot the bill for this expensive ride. ,1
 I am very unhappy with this particular ride. This driver shows a high traffic route to take me to my destination. There were other routes where I could have made it there quicker and the driver did not take those routes. I am very upset because this made me very late for my engagement.,1
I know traffic happens. I should have done a better job planning for it. But the route this driver took was insane. It's like he was aiming for the traffic. ,1
Poor decision maker and didn't follow GPS  and/or warnings about traffic. Cost me a ton both monetarily and professionally. Charged me for a 45 minute delay in traffic.  Do Not Recommend.,1
"I had a very unpleasant experience with one of the drivers that resulted in some difficulties for me on the job.  Rather than taking a simple and fairly quick route that would have gotten me to work on time, this driver chose a route that was heavily trafficked which caused me to be 45 minutes late to work and caused me to miss an important meeting, which resulted in an unpleasant encounter with my boss.  I believe this was a deliberate attempt to earn a larger fare (which it did!).  I will never allow this driver to drive for me again, and if anything like this happens again in the future with another driver, the company will lose my business for good.",1
I was not impressed with my Uber experience. The driver took a strange route to my  job even when I told him there was a faster route. I arrived to work 45 minutes late. This caused some issues with my superiors and also cost our company an important contract. I am not happy with the service. ,1
"I will never use the driver from uber again. I will also consider not using uber in the future. The uber driver took a route that was high in traffic which the driver could have avoided. This traffic caused a 45 minute delay and I was late to work. When I arrived at work ""LATE"" because of the uber driver taking a route that was full of traffic I was lucky not to get fired.  The driver from uber caused me to be late at work. This caused a domino effect of several problems at work because I was late. The driver had access to maps and should have chosen a different route to get me to work on time.",1
"the driver was not cautious and took a route in which there was a lot of traffic so he made me arrive very late to my destination, an important meeting, causing serious problems in my work",1
"The driver took a route with a lot of traffic, which resulted in my being 45 minutes late to work. Because of this I missed a very important meeting, a contract was cancelled, and I got yelled at by my boss. I realize that this was a mistake, but it really costed me time, money, and possibly future job stability.",1
"I have to say that this driver is probably the worst I have ever had using this company. Not only did he try to bilk me by taking a long route that caused me a lengthy delay and a higher fee, he also caused me considerable harm at work by doing this. I would give a rating of zero if I could - he was and is the worst driver I have ever had - so much so, I am considering never using this service again based solely on this experience. If this is the level of driver they employ, then its just not worth it in any way for me to continue using this service. ",1
Horrible driver. Didn't know alternate routes to my destination. Got us stuck in a massive traffic jam. Made me late to work and an important meeting. Would never use again. ,1
"The driver chose a route with a ton of traffic, which made me miss an important meeting at work. I was also overcharged for the ride. Very disappointed.",1
The driver was not very good cause he didn't know the optimal route to my destination.  And on top of the cost were way to high.  This caused me to be late to work on top of that,1
Unfortunately I did not have a very good experience with this driver.  I am not sure why but they chose the route with the heaviest traffic and it caused me to me extremely late for a very important business meeting.  I am not sure if they just are unfamiliar with the area or were looking to have their fare bumped up but either way I would not recommend this person to anyone.,1
This person purposely took a long way so that I would have to pay more. I ended up late for an important meeting at work and got in trouble. I do NOT recommend this driver!!!,1
I had an important meeting in my office and if i don't attend that meeting my the contract being cancelled and my boss shouted at me. The driver took the traffic route so that he can earn more money. I was really frustrated that why i had taken this uber ride and i want that driver should be fired from his job.,1
My driver took a bad route to work that ended up getting us stuck in traffic for far too long. I ended up missing an important meeting and screwing up company business because of my driver's bad routing.,1
Had a bad experience with the driver due to them choosing a very congested route. I was very late to an important affair. Hope it was just a bad day for them.,1
"I wanted to get to work for a meeting. So I used the app to get a driver. So far, so good. The guy shows up pretty much on time, but then proceeds to take the route with the most traffic. I wind up 45 minutes late, missed the meeting, and got yelled at by my boss for blowing a contract. This is the worst driver I have ever encountered.",1
My driver was not very good at navigating traffic this morning. He took the long way around to work and I was very late. All of this and the fare came in very overpriced.,1
Yeah. It's very disappointing at the moment and  Alice is sometime's very quick and almost missed an important meeting in to the normal mode of the negative response.,0
"Although a nice driver, the experience was not positive. The chosen route had a large amount of traffic, resulting in me being very late to my destination. The results of this were very bad. I would not ride with this driver again.",1
I was incredibly late to work due to this driver's decisons. As such I was unneccesarily repremanded by my boss. This driver needs to learn alternate routes or something before picking people up again during busy hours.,1
"The absolute worst ever!!! I wouldn't get in his car if I was paid too, and I wouldn't recommend you do either. I never experienced anything like this before.",1
"Don't ride with this driver. He made a poor choice of routes making me very late for work. I told him I had to get to work on time, but he still took a route with tons of traffic. I was so upset knowing I was late for work, and we were stuck in traffic. Then he had the nerve to charge me a lot for the ride when he should have offered a discount for his poor decisions. Don't make my mistake-pick another driver!",1
"I felt that the driver took an inferior route and caused me to be late to my destination. Everyone's time is important. This driver should have striven to get me to my destination asap, from my sake, as well as theirs.",1
"This was a horrible experience, the driver took a route that had tons of traffic which resulted in me being late to work.  There was a much better way to get there and yet the driver would not take it .  ",1
This driver took the worst possible route and the fee with all the delays was exorbitant. I had a terrible trip to work and the delay cause me all kinds of problems.,1
"Driver took very indirect routes. As a result, I was late to work and missed an important meeting. Will NEVER use this driver again! Stay away from this driver!",1
"The driver did not take the optimal route which resulted in my being late by 45 minutes and missing and important meeting which resulted in the loosing the client. I was also charged more than the normal fair ride share for such an incredible inconvenience,",1
My driver chose a horrible route and I was late by 45 minutes. They then charged me an unfair rate for their mistake! I will avoid this driver at all costs.,1
That driver is a good driver. He made my travel as a safe travel. Still he need to improve little more his knowledge in choose the quick route than navigation.,0
"Driver took a route that made me 45 minutes late. The price was absurd, especially given the roundabout way they got me to my destination. Not pleased.",1
This driver did not choose a proper route to take. He chose a very busy route that in turn led me to pay a higher price than I normally would have and also caused many issues at my place of employment. ,1
"Ended up being late for work and missed a meeting because route was full of back ups and traffic.  Also got charged a lot because of long trip.  Not sure if the driver could have done better, but not a great expereince",0
The driver was really nice but he didn't seem to know where he was going and I was 45 minutes late. I even told him and suggested ways to go but he did not follow my instructions.,1
This driver was courteous and kind however he took the extemely long route to my job. I ended up having to pay a high amount as well as be late to work and miss an important meeting. I do not recommend.,1
I recently took an Uber to work. The driver chose a route with heavy traffic which made me 45 minutes late to work. I missed an important meeting and suffered repercussions due to the drivers choice of route. I would not ride with this driver if you are trying to get somewhere by a specific time. ,1
The driver took a route that is typically very congested and took an unreasonable amount of time to get me to my destination. On top of all of this I was charged an exorbitant amount of money for the trip due to the 45 minute delay!,1
"While the ride itself was pleasant, the route taken added an additional 45 minutes to my riding time, therefore increasing what I had to pay.  Because of the route chosen, it affected my work in a very negative manner and I lost business due to this.  If the driver had chosen a less busy route, it would not have taken as long as it did.  ",1
"Driver took the longest route possible which resulted in a 45 minute delay in getting to work as well as a much higher price than I normally pay. Not only was I late to work because of this, but I also faced several consequences. I absolutely would NOT recommend or use this driver ever again.",1
"My driver did not make any attempt to avoid heavy traffic. Because of this, we took 45 minutes longer than we needed to. I was late to an important business meeting and lost a contract. On top of that all, the price for the ride was outrageous!",1
THE LAST RIDE I CONTRACTED FOR WITH UBER WAS UNACCEPTABLE. THE DRIVER TOOK A ROUTE THAT HAD A LOT OF TRAFFIC. THE RIDE TOOK 45 MINUTES AND THE PRICE I PAID WAS EXCESSIVE. THE RIDE RESULTED IN AN IN MISSING AN IMPORTANT MEETING AND COULD HAVE BEEN AVOIDED IF A BETTER ROUTE HAD BEEN TAKEN.,1
I ended up being late to an important meeting due to traffic. I feel like the driver could have taken a faster route and should have been aware of potential traffic.,1
"My driver picked a long, heavily congested route to get me to my location. consequently i was 45 minutes late for my meeting. my client was furious at my lateness and my boss yelled at me. ive never had such a bad experience with ths service before.",1
"The driver took a route that had an unacceptable amount of traffic. There are very simple navigation apps to get around this, and not using them properly was unacceptable. I was also charged far too much for the ride. This whole experience cost me both time and money. ",1
"Shortest route was congested. Rather than ask me if i wanted to take an alternatve, driver moseyed along in traffic, taking 45 mins. I missed a meeting at work and was charged an outrageous price for what should have been a ten minute trip. Not a happy camper",1
"I had booked Uber for going to office, I didn't him driver about my urgency and so he had taken route with huge traffic by thinking as very less distance, because of him I didn't attend meeting which had been cancelled, after entering in to traffic I informed about my urgency, so he didn't able to do anything. Anyways I missed my meeting and got scoldings from my boss.",1
"Route chosen was extremely poor, resulting in my being 45 minutes late for important work meeting. Proper use of traffic information such as Waze is critical.",1
with out a basic route skills and he also charged me high rate ...i was late 45 min because of the driver very very poor skills for the driver ...the day was too bad only because of driver ,1
it was a very bad experience as the driver picked me up late and took up the long route in spite of telling him that this route will have a lot of heavy traffic at this time of the day.He was basically very adamant and i felt him to be rude and did not understand my concern and there by i was stuck in traffic for a very long time which delayed my schedule.,1
"This trip irritated me a lot. Due to the wrong route taken by the driver, I arrived late at the office and I missed an important meeting. My boss got pissed with me. Price charged was also high in-spite of late dropping. I am totally upset.",1
"My driver took a route that got me stuck in traffic for 45 minutes, making me later for work and yelled by my boss. To top it off I had to pay an exorbitant price for this when price for this ride.  ",1
This Uber driver does not take optimal routes. The driver turned my trip into an unnecessarily long nightmare waiting in traffic for forty five minutes.,1
My driver was a moron. They went he wrong way to my job and I was late to work and missed a meeting over them being an idiot. They should not be able to work in this line of field if they don't know how to get places quickly. ,1
"This driver took a long way that got us stuck in traffic. I was very late for my work because of this and got into trouble with my boss and at my job. The driver got a lot more money because of the longhauling, but I got screwed. I wouldn't use this driver again. ",1
He took a stupid route and made me late to work and charged me a ridiculous amount. My job is in jepordy because he wanted to take the long route to charge me more. ,1
"This driver took me on a high-traffic road when I was trying to get to work on time. I ended up being late to work, and with the drive taking longer due to the traffic, I was charged extra for the extra time. Very frustrating experience, though it was only partly the driver's fault.",1
"One of the worst experiences I have had. I think he purposely took a route with a lot of traffic, in order to be able to charge me more. Due to that, the route took much longer than usual and I was late to work which had severe consequences. Horrible experience overall.",1
"The driver not only chose to go an extra long route, but we got stuck in the long route as well. Because of this I was late for a meeting and lost a contract. ",1
"The driver did not look for a route that was not busy and had a lot delays , but took a route that cost me more money and getting to work really late and caused more problems for me, I would not suggest this drive for any regular work day ",1
The driver didn't seem to know the best route to take to avoid traffic at this time of day. My ride to work took way longer than it should have and as a result I was late for work with serious repercussions. To add insult to injury the ride was very expensive. ,1
The driver took a route that was longer than necessary and that caused me to be late for an important meeting. I was also charged a really high price. Avoid at all cost!,1
this driver is not clear in route so its getting me delayed to the meeting and the project was cancelled so i lost the project also he bought too much money,1
"i dont like him because he didnt arrived on time, so i will not book ride after this in your company. i will choose better one for my ride because time is more important for me.",1
Standard pick up but driver opted for a heavy traffic route and then I was charged for that extra time. I felt he was milking the drive. Not only did it cost me in money but because I was late to work it cost me double with a cancelled client. ,1
"I was very upset that this driver took a very crowded route to get me to my destination, I was late for work.  I was also charged a very high amount. I will re-think taking this service in the future. ",1
"The delivery person failed to perform one of the basic functions of their job, which was ensuring the product they picked up was correct. Because of this, i was stuck without lunch for the day and i wasted money on top of it. I would only order from this person again, if they make sure the order is correct.",1
"The delivery guy was courteous although he did not check that what I ordered was what I received. I think he should have been more proactive because my order was screwed up with foods I'm allergic to, and I had to go hungry because of it.",1
"My order was completely wrong, I didn't receive part of the special and I couldn't even eat it due to allergy concerns. Peanut butter was added when I clearly states no peanut butter. Very annoyed. I wasted my time and my money.",0
"The delivery was on time but was not correct in any way. The restaurant sent the meal missing an ingredient and with peanut butter, which I am allergic to. It was a very bad delivery experience, but this is due to the restaurant and not the delivery person. ",0
THE DELIVERY PERSON BROUGHT ME MY ITEM BUT IT WAS MISSING SOME INGREDIENTS.  ALSO I REQUESTED NO PEANUT SAUCE AS I AM ALLERGIC TO PEANUTS AND IT CAME WITH PEANUTS MISSED MY LUNCH AND DO NOT HAVE TIME TO REORDER.  NOW I WILL BE HUNGRY ALL DAY.  I AM UPSET.  THE PERSON SHOULD HAVE DOUBLE CHECKED THE DELIVERY,1
"This meal was prepared wrong and I could not eat it. However, I cannot blame this on the delivery person, who was just doing  their job. The delivery was the only thing that went right here.",0
"I'm not sure if the delivery person who delivered my lunch knew about the problem with the order, but I did not get what I ordered. It came smothered with peanut butter, which I am highly allergic to, forcing me to have to skip my lunch for lack of cash, and time. I had to work all day without eating lunch. So ANGRY!!!",0
"The delivery person did their job and delivered my meal, but they clearly did nothing to assure themselves the order was correct, as it was completely wrong and contained an ingredient I am allergic to and SPECIFICALLY REQUESTED not be added to my meal. The delivery person should care enough when receiving the order from the restaurant to verify that it is what I ordered. I will not use this service again, as it's clearly not their policy to check my order before they deliver it.",1
My meal was delivered on time and the delivery person was nice. However the meal arrived missing a key ingredient and I requested leaving off a nut spread as I am allergic to nuts. My meal arrived covered in the spread so I was unable to eat it. I guess I go without lunch today.,0
The delivery person completed their task and job adequately and I received my order. They do not deserve blame for the significant errors made by the restaurant that prepared my food.,0
"The delivery person was prompt, kind, and professional, however my order was wrong. This company should do a better job of double checking orders before sending them out.",0
I got the food in a timely manner.  I have no problem with the delivery person.  I just wish he had checked the order before he brought it.  The order was wrong but it was not his fault.,0
"The delivery person was fast! Unfortunately my order was screwed up and included items I am allergic to. I was unable to eat my meal. However, this is not the fault of the delivery person and they were kind and courteous.",0
the person that ordered the food was allergic to nuts and when ordered they gave her peanut butter and there was no money to order anything and out of time on lunch break.,0
"I would not be mad with the delivery person as they are only the messenger, meaning that they were not the person who made the food order specifically.  It is not the delivery person's fault that the order was incorrect.  Although I would be not pleased with the situation, the deliver person is not to blame.",0
"I had no problem with the delivery person.  The problem was from the restaurant where I ordered their food.  They did not honor any of my food requests.  I can't eat peanut butter, and my food was slathered with peanut butter.  I could not eat it, and I went without lunch.  I am not a happy camper.",0
The delivery person is incapable for this job.He doesn't fit for this job.He has to see what the customer has ordered clearly and then he has to bring it to the customer exactly what he or she ordered.,1
"I just received my lunch order today. I order the special, which is my favorite from there, but without peanut sauce as I'm allergic. I opened my food to find the order was wrong and had the peanut sauce all over it. Also, the unique sauce specific for this item was not on it at all. That's why I order this! But of course, this isn't the drivers fault. The driver delivery to me in a timely manner.",0
The delivery person was horrible and I do not believe they tried their hardest to get me the correct ingredients that I required. I do not think I would use this service again in the future.,1
"I know the delivery person didn't cook my food, but it is their job to check orders before they go out to their deliveries, just like a waiter at a restaurant. If I were at a restaurant, I'd send the food back and it would be made right, but my delivery person made no such offers and now I am out of lunch, out of money for another, and out of time to eat, so my rumbly tummy will have to keep me company for the rest of the day. My order arrived without bananas, and slathered in peanut butter, to which I am deathly allergic. I could die from the sloppy work of my delivery person today!",1
"I was so looking forward to my meal. However, the order was not only incorrect it had peanut butter spread on it and I am allergic to nuts and was unable to eat it at all. Now, I am hungry and out of time and money and must go through the entire day with any food. ",0
 The delivery person did not check my order. My meal came with an item that I am allergic to and an ingredient that was suppose to be in the meal was not in it. I am disappointed.,1
This place screwed up my meal and caused me to miss lunch. They did not take into consideration my allergies (especially when this is one of the main allergies people can have). I will never go back.,0
The delivery person didn't pay attention to the order at all. I am allergic to nuts but it had tons of peanut butter on it.  I ordered it with my favorite ingredient but it didn't have any at all.  I am wondering if this person is able to read at all.  I had to skip lunch all together.  I am not at all satisfied with the service!,1
I was at work and ordered my favorite food but this rocket scientist brought me the exact opposite so that I could not eat it AND had to get back to work so could not order again.,1
"So disappointed with the service that I received! Despite the fact that I requested no peanut butter due to my severe peanut allergy, my lunch came covered with peanut butter making it totally inedible. I had to go hungry for the rest of the day due to this mistake. This was extremely careless and irresponsible, especially since I could have had a very severe reaction if I hadn't caught the mistake. Very dissatisfied!",0
The delivery person is making the best effort to make the delivery in a timely manner.They are going to the restaurant to pick up the food for a a client,0
"I know it's no the delivery partner's fault, it's the restaurant.  The delivery was fine, but beware when ordering from this place because they can get orders wrong.  You are advised to call the place as well as placing your order through the app.",0
"I I am very unhappy with the meal I just received from Grub-Hub, Not only was my order ignored for my meal to have my favorite sauce, they inexplicably coated the meal with a peanut sauce, of which I am highly allergic, I do not blame the driver, save for the fact that there should have been a way for them to check the meal before accepting it. Now I have no lunch, no time,  and m=no money to buy anything further. This needs to be addressed",0
The food was delivered on time but the food was not made to my specifications.  I asked for my food to be made without peanuts as I am allergic however it was covered in peanuts.  Please make sure you are delivering the correct food when you deliver.  ,0
The delivery person got the food to me on time.  It was not their fault that the order was wrong.  The order was wrong because of the people at the restaurant.   They messed up what I was looking so forward to. The driver did all he was supposed to do and I give him  a good review for that.,1
"Unfortunately the delivery person failed to verify that my order was correct. Not only was it wrong, but it could have been deadly to me based on food allergies I have.  I feel the delivery person got paid performing a service, whereas their failure to be diligent left me with no money and no lunch.",1
I ordered a meal and the delivery person brought a meal that was prepared incorrectly.  I expect the delivery person to confirm that the food they're bringing me is the food that I ordered.  It's useless to pay extra for someone to bring me food I can't eat.,1
The delivery person seemed to do everything correctly. The delivery person was a capable person.He or she is only responsible for delivery the food in a timely manner.,0
"The delivery person didn't bother to know the taste, likes & dislikes of the person who ordered the food. The delivery person must note down the taste, wants, preferences of the person so to avoid disappointments of clients in future. There order should be deliver within time as expected from the clients. I would rate down the delivery person due to lack of knowledge and taste of clients.",1
"I had a terrible experience with the delivery service from this app. I received my special item of the day with it plastered with peanut butter when I specifically asked for nothing of the kind. This was unacceptable. Not only am I allergic to nuts but was out of money to buy something else. So I had to go through the rest of my day without eating anything. Luckily I'm not a diabetic. I would not recommend this, too dangerous and my work suffered as well.",0
"I ordered and payed for my lunch meal, but after delivery I discovered that the ,main ingredient of the meal I purchased was missing. This was one of the main reasons I ordered from this restaurant, very disappointed here. The order also included peanut butter and I am allergic to peanuts, once again very let down. Because of these things I have not recommended this restaurant again. Very bad service.",0
"I was not satisfied with my order at all. My delivery person was prompt to deliver my meal, however, I was unable to eat it at all. I ordered no peanut butter as I have a severe allergy and yet my food came slathered in it. I also ordered this meal for my favorite ingredient which wasn't added! This isn't the delivery person's fault but I am not satisfied.",0
"It was not really the delivery person's fault, but the order was unacceptable. I have nothing against the delivery person, since he/she  only takes the order from the restaurant to me, but it would have been nice if they could have verified everything.",0
The delivery person was good and get the food here on time but the food I get was not the food I order. This had peanuts and I can't eat that on top of not what I wanted,0
"They didn't bring what I ordered, plus they ignored my nut allergy. I didn't get a chance to eat lunch because of this! I will never eat at this place again. ",0
"The delivery person that took my order from Grubhub was not very attentive to my special dietary needs. Because of this persons innattentiveness not only was I not able to eat my lunch but could have gotten seriously ill. I cannot eat peanut butter, requested that my meal not have the peanut sauce but I still received it. I certainly am quite upset, not only did I go all day without lunch because I did not have enough cash to order something else I feel quite cheated.",1
"Food was delivered and on time, but the order was not checked for accuracy. There was a missing ingredient and I'm allergic to peanuts and they put peanut butter on it when I specifically asked that it not be on there and I could not eat the meal. Very disappointed. ",0
"I recently purchase my meal online. When I got it, it was the wrong order. This is not the delivery person's fault, they did their job and got my meal to me on a timely manner. I blame the establishment itself for not fulfilling my order correctly.",0
"I would have no complaints about my delivery person, as they are not the one that prepared the meal I ordered incorrectly. I also did not have any information about the delivery person, themselves, in the scenario I read. ",0
I can not blame the delivery person. But my order was all wrong. It really upset me because I couldnt eat it.  There was peanut butter on it and I am allergic to peanuts and my favorite item was not in the order.,0
"My meal was completely wrong and not what I ordered.  It included peanut butter which I am allergic to.  It was quite disappointing to have to go all day without lunch.  However, this situation was not the fault of the delivery driver.  He was simply delivering my meal.  He was friendly and courteous and arrived on time.  He would have no way of knowing that my meal was wrong. ",0
She was nice and courteous. It was not her fault that the restaurant messed up the order. She is just trying to get by just like the rest of us. She was patient and had a friendly smile. ,0
The delivery person was slower than expected and was not as nice as she could had been. She didn't seem to enjoy delivering my food that I ordered and didnt really smile or have a nice attitude.,1
"I have no complaints with the delivery driver. My issue was with the food itself. My order was royalty screwed up. Perhaps the driver picked up the wrong order, but more likely it is the restaurant’s fault.",0
"The delivery person was fine, the meal was delivered on time. The real issue was the meal itself, which is not the delivery person's fault. it was missing an ingredient that is the sole reason for ordering the meal. And on top of that, it contained an ingredient I told them to leave off that I'm allergic to. But again, not the delivery person's fault, but the restaurant so I'll leave a proper complaint with them.",0
I was very upset and angry over the restaurant. They should take care of customer's needs and must fulfill them. They must have ask opinion with the customers. ,0
The delivery person did not check my order.  It was not what I ordered and sadly not even close.  My lunch hour was over before I got my order and it not only was wrong it was so wrong that I was alergic to ingredients on it.  Now I am unhappy and have no lunch.  I am very disappointed with this service today.,1
"This is my favorite restaurant and I order from here quite often. I ordered the meal of the day today and requested only one thing, that it not have peanut butter spread. I am allergic to nuts, and not only that but the meal came without my favorite ingredient as well, which is why I ordered the meal in the first place. Now I am out of money and out of time and will have to go through the rest of the day without food. I am only giving points for the driver arriving on time and acting in a professional manner.",0
"I ordered from this company. While the delivery person was fine, the order was completely incorrect. I ordered the daily special but it was missing a key ingredient. Also, due to an allergy, I asked for no peanut butter, but it was covered in it. Because of this, I ran out of time for lunch and had to go the whole day without anything while at work.",0
I have nothing bad to say about the delivery person. The delivery person is not the one to blame for the incorrectly prepared meal. The person who prepared meal without reading my instructions is the one who ruined my lunch. Not happy.,0
"I ordered my favorite lunch special from a restaurant that I have frequented previously.  I was very specific in my order, asking for no peanut butter spread as I have a nut allergy.  Although the delivery was on time and the delivery person was courteous, I am extremely dissatisfied with the service. The order was missing my favorite ingredient and it came plastered with the peanut butter spread.  I had to forgo my lunch today.  Very disappointed in this service.",0
"My order was dangerously incorrect. It included items I am very allergic to and specifically asked not be included. The delivery driver did not check that this instruction was followed, and delivered my inedible meal. She should have double-checked before she left the restaurant. ",1
"Although the delivery person was fast and courteous, they did not take the time to make sure that my order was correct. The meal I ordered did not have the most important ingredient included, which was the reason I ordered that particular meal. The meal also included a large amount of peanut butter, although I specified that it should not have any peanuts since I am allergic to them. I couldn't eat the meal, and had to go without lunch. I wish this delivery person had taken the time to verify that the order was correct before delivering it. ",1
"Everything I ordered was wrong, deathly so. I ordered no peanuts as I am allergic but the meal came covered in peanuts. There is no excuse for so many errors. ",0
"The delivery arrived on time and he was polite and courteous.  However, my experience was overall terrible because I did not receive what I ordered.  The entire reason I ordered this dish was for my favorite ingredient and the dish came without it.  If that wasn't bad enough, I ordered it without peanut spread because I'm allergic to peanuts, and of course it arrives covered in peanut spread.  I cannot even eat this dish now.  I would use the delivery service again, but not for this restaurant who severely messed up my order.",0
"I had a horrible experience! The delivery person forgot to make sure my favorite ingredient was included! Not only that, but there was peanut butter added which I am allergic to! I give this delivery person only 1 out of 5 stars, they just don't care!",1
I asked to make sure there was no peanut butter spread and they delivered it with peanut butter spread.  I am alergic to peanuts and cannot eat this at all so this is not a matter of preferance but of life and death.  Is it that hard to simply check to make sure they did not put peanut butter spread on it. ,0
"Delivery was fine, not their fault things didn't go right. But the restaurant messed up my order with no way to correct it... no lunch now, I'm allergic. Oh, well.",0
"I ordered a meal with specific ingredients, but what i got was wasn't what i had placed as my order. I didn't want peanut butter, but there it was spread all over my meals bread. I just couldn't eat this meal, i was mad because i didn't have an option for a refund or the capability to order another meal. The delivery person should've doubled checked with me. I'm quite upset.  ",1
"What I ordered came  without my favorite ingredient (this is why I ordered that meal!), and to make matters worse, I ordered no peanut butter because I'm allergic to nuts, and the food came plastered with peanut butter. The entire order was inedible and I had to go without lunch that day. Waste of money!",0
"The meal was terrible, it was plastered with peanut butter which I am allergic to and it was missing my favorite ingredient which was the reason I oredered this exact item",0
I received my food in a timely fashion and the delivery driver was nice but the order was completely wrong and I could not eat it due to a food allergy. Not the driver's fault but the restaurant and the person who prepared it.,0
"I don't blame the delivery person, it's not like they look at the food, but whoever made my order completely screwed up. This is not okay. It didn't have what I wanted on it, instead it had the ONE thing I said not to put on it.",0
i received the meal on time however the order was completely wrong and i am allergic to nuts! what's the point of delivering something if it's completely useless!,0
"Very bad experience! My order came without my favorite ingredient (this is why I ordered that meal!). Additionally, I ordered the meal to not have peanut butter spread, the food came plastered with peanut butter. You could not eat the meal. My lunch break is over and I am out of cash to buy something else. I had to go through the day without lunch!",0
My delivery person was great. Delivered the food. The restaurant screwed up  my lunch though and I had nothing to eat or any money to get something else to eat for the rest of the day.,0
The delivery person was friendly and on time.  I have no complaints about him personally.  It wasn't his fault the restaurant massively screwed the order and I was unable to eat it due to my peanut allergy.,0
I don’t have an issue with the delivery person because they are only delivering the food. But he restaurant messed my order up. And it was to the extent of giving me peanut butter and I told them I was allergic to it/ I was very disappointed and upset!,0
"Not sure if this was all her fault; however it would have been nice if she checked the food before she left the store. She did a good t=job, just not thorough one. A lot of blame goes back to the restaurant.",1
I was very disappointed that this delivery person did not realized that I have a nut allergy.  I will never order from them again.  They should be more concerned about the health of their customers.,1
"The delivery person brought me my food on time, but did not get the order right. It was missing things I asked for and had things I did not ask for on it. It was not what I wanted when I ordered the food through the app.",1
"The delivery was not what I ordered, however this is not the fault of the person delivering the meal. This is on the restaurant. THe only reason I did not give five stars is that the overall service was not good due to me being out time, money and not getting what I ordered.",0
I really liked this delivery person because this delivery person is very hard worker and this person is very honest.This delivery person always delverd his delivery on time and never waste the others time.I like to order this delivery person whenever i need something.,0
"There was nothing particularly wrong with the delivery person.  They just delivered what they were given by the restaurant.  My overall experience was bad because my order was completely wrong.  I hold the restaurant, not the delivery person responsible for this.",0
"The delivery person brought my order, but it wasn't what I was expecting.  It wasn't his/her fault, but it was still a disappointing experience.  Now I'm hungry and somewhat disgruntled.",0
"My delivery person delivered the meal promptly. I appreciated their service. Unfortunately, my meal order was all wrong. I do not think this issue had anything to do with the delivery person though.",0
The person brought the food on time. Im upset that the order is wrong. They put peanut butter and they should have not. Im allergic and not I cant eat anything for lunch,0
I am upset that I can't eat what I ordered because it came with nuts. I am allergic so I cannot eat this entire order without getting violently sick and ill.,0
This worker was delayed in submitting their response and close to the deadline.  They also did not proofread their work.  The end of their submission was cut off and therefore was not completed.  Believe that this worker needs to be more careful with future submissions.,1
"I submitted a report to be translated from English to French.  I do not read French and relied upon this worker to translate the work.  This document was very important to my client.  Unfortunately, the worker did not complete the translation and returned the work in an unfinished state.  As I do not read French, I submitted the work to the client and he was disappointed.  If you hire this worker, make sure to verify the end product!",1
"This worker did a bad job at translation. They did not translate the full text and as result, it caused business issues and I lost a client. I would not recommend this user for any work, especially translation.",1
"I was very frustrated with her work, and it was cut off. Due to her, I have lost my contract with this client. I wasn't sure what she was thinking submitting a translation like that!",1
"The work was unacceptable. There should have been a check to see if it was correct. Obviously that didn't happen. If I wanted someone to input some text and push a button and print it out without checking it, I would train a monkey to do it. Terrible unprofessional work.",1
"My worker was not responsible with her job that I have given to her. She cheated me by not performing a better job and maybe not even sure what she was doing. Probably, she was just using a google translation to help translate it to French.  It shows that she was a irresponsible person that does not care about what she was doing. ",1
It is unprofessional to submit corrupted or incomplete work. The submitted work actually cost me a client. This is not a good or reliable service and I would avoid at all costs. ,1
The idea behind this service is that a bi-lingual person will fully translate my documents into the chosen language and it will be done carefully and completely.  That was not the case with this project and the errors contained in the translated document caused my company to lose a contract and caused me to look bad.  I am extremely frustrated and mad that this worker barely completed this task before the deadline and the document contained errors.  I would not use this service again and woukd not recommend it.  I expect a full refund and am considering legal action.,1
"I submitted an essay to Worker A for a simple translation from English to French with a firm delivery date. Worker A submitted the work at the very last minute which prevented me from having a chance to proofread it and correct any potential errors. In addition, he submitted the document in a format that truncated the last few words of the essay so it turned out to be an incomplete document. I had no other choice but to trust his work before submitting it to my client. I was not aware that words were missing and submitted it that way. My client, of course, was less than impressed and less than satisfied leading to them cancelling further project work that I had been slated to do. I lost money and suffered a damaged reputation as a result. Do not trust Worker A. He has no quality standards in place to insure his work is up to par and he doesn't respect deadlines.",1
"I think she's an irresponsible person, besides that she has an improper working style, ruining all the plans, I think I won't cooperate with her next time.",1
"I do not recommend this worker based on my previous use of outsourcing to her an important essay. She failed to complete it throughly, rather rushed, therefore creating a bad impression on my work client. As a result my client limited their contract with my business. ",1
"I am disappointed in the work that she did not even finish the work, and it was so close to the deadline I wonder if she even worked hard at all. I will not be working with this worker again. ",1
"While I appreciate the worker's attempt to translate my essay, I feel she did not exhibit careful attention to detail. I feel it was not edited properly, which affected the message of my essay in a negative way and made me look incompetent in the eyes of others.",0
"Alice did a good job on her translation, however she did not check the final product to realize that it was cut off and not complete. Alice caused my final presentation to be unsuccessful due to this error. The quality of her work was good, but incomplete and rushed. Will not rehire. ",0
This worker is not reliable. I received incomplete work from this person. I was very dissatisfied with the quality of with that i received from this worker. ,1
"Working with this person was a pain in the ass! It costed me a contract due to his negligence. I do not recommend working with him, as he's not meticulous and diligent. ",1
The worker failed at fully completing the task that was given.  This resulted in an unfinished project and the company has decided to have limited business dealings with my company.,1
Worker did not complete the job correctly and submitted work that was cut off at the end resulting in a a dissatisfied client. I would not recommend this worker for future translation work. This person is unprofessional and untrustworthy.,1
"I was very upset to see such a behavior from my worker. Given the importance of the work and client, I didn't expect my client to give such an incomplete work. This will have very adverse effects in my future relationship with them. I might even lose future opportunities from them. It is because of her last minute attitude this mistake has occurred. If this work was submitted earlier. She might have found any mistakes present. This might have prevented her work going in this direction and all other consequences. I expect that she will be more careful in future and won't repeat this attitude in future and work after understanding the importance of the work.",1
I do not recommend this worker. The translation work was incomplete and submitted at the last minute. The shoddy work resulted in an unhappy client. I am very upset.,1
I am not happy with this worker. I had an article that I needed translated into french. The work was submitted just before I needed to turn it in. I found out later that it was incomplete. My client decided that my company was not worth doing business with. I am so not happy with this worker.,1
"I counted on my worker to do a very important task. It was clear they messed it up or ""took the easy way"" and really affected relations with my client. Would not recommend this worker for future projects.",1
"I am very upset with this worker. I trusted them. They fully knew that I did not understand French. This was very important, and I needed the whole essay translated correctly. Turning this in makes me look unprofessional. It paints me in a very negative light, and I feel like a fool and an idiot. I am furious. ",1
Translation was fine but worker made a grave effort in proofreading of the document itself. The last portion was cut off which resulted in a poor impression from my French client. Will not use this person again.,0
"It seems like the worker had either one of two problems.They either took on too many tasks and weren't able to ensure that the work was up to a proper standard, which is bad for their rating and the people they're doing the work for, or, they simply didn't take my work seriously and was ok with having it be badly done because of how they treated the deadline and didn't ensure that it was properly put into the system.",1
"I am incredibly displeased with the translations service offered by this worker. They appear to have just quit working at the end and left me with a partially translated message instead of the entire thing! This is completely unacceptable and has caused me a great deal of problems. I was paying to have the entire thing done, not only whatever they wanted to do. I would not recommend them at all.",1
"When using this platform, I trusted this worker to translate my article for an important client, and I was disappointed.  The worker did not do the job as they said they would, and it had a very negative impact on my job. I would not recommend this person at all.",1
The worker returned my essay just before the deadline and it was incomplete. This poor quality resulted in a reduction of my services with my client. Possibly the company assigns too much work to each of their employees which could have resulted in the incomplete essay being returned to me with little time to spare. I will choose a different company in the future.,1
"The worker submitted poor and incomplete work. They submitted too close to the deadline with little wiggle room, making it impossible to fix or check for any issues.",1
"The worker did not finish the job until almost the deadline, he/she did not finish it completely. He/ she caused me trouble with his/her bad quality work. He/she can't be trusted and reliable. I would not want to work with him/her again.",1
The translation submitted was not submitted.until moments before the deadline to complete the job. This did not allow me time.to look it over. I was unable to comtact them about it being truncated due to.submission time. Things like this should not be handed in last minute. ,0
"the worker from what i can tell did a good job but when it was submitted, it seemingly cut off a good portion of the message i needed translated. this is really not a good thing for me from the worker since it is not complete and accurate",0
"I expected a good job but was very disappointed. The results were incomplete, and this should have been noticed and corrected before I presented it to a very important client who I had hoped to impress.",1
"I had a very important proposal to give to an important potential client who only spoke French. As I only speak English I contracted with this worker to translate it for me. I got the translation back just in time. After presenting it to the client she informed me that it was incomplete and the last word was missing. As a result, my company lost most of this client's business. I will not be contracting this worker again.",1
"This translator did not do the job for which I paid. The submission was made very close to the deadline, and I did not have time to properly review it. Perhaps I should have made the deadline earlier so I could double-check the work. However, I am not myself a translator, and so of course I did also trust that the translator would at least submit a correct, complete translation. That did not happen either. The translation was cut off. My client was very unhappy with the translation, and blamed me. It is correct that I receive the blame in this situation, because I am the one who hired a translator and trusted that person to do a good job, and then was let down. But I am distressed because my client is reconsidering the business relationship the client has with me. I feel that had the translation been correct and complete this would have not happened. ",1
Unfortunately I am very dissatisfied with this persons work.  They did not complete the work however they lead me to believe that they had.  They are dishonest and untrustworthy  in business matters.  Thanks the inadequate translation they cost me future work.  I hope this person improves there work quality in the future. ,1
The worker made a bad impression with the quality of work so now our client thinks negatively of us which impacted our relationship and reputation! This is not good because we are often making clients based on our history of work.,1
"I did not receive the service I expected. The results were incomplete and it jeopardized my reputation with my client. I would not recommend anyone working with this imbecile, it's too much of a risk.",1
Worker X did not have the ambition or want on the assignment to make it successful. They waited till until the last minute and seemingly rushed through it resulting in a less than stellar job. The resulting work is unacceptable and I am wary to work with this employee again. ,1
I was given an incomplete work from this worker. Since I don't know french I can't verify the work if it is accurate.  I put a lot of trust to this worker but then stab me in the back. Don't hire this worker. ,1
I am not satisfied with my worker. The character limit had to be cut off and their entire writing was not submitted. I actually want to give them the benefit of the doubt. Maybe there is a text limit in the messaging system of upwork. Maybe it is not their fault. I find it strange to believe that they copy and pasted from a search engine because the article could have clearly been double checked. Honestly why didn't I just used Google Translate instead of paying somebody else? It's a free service and takes only seconds. Maybe a minute tops if your internet is trash. That would have made the most sense. ,0
"The translation was left off until the last minute. Also, it was horribly done and almost seemed to just have been thrown into Google translate. I do not think the worker did even a mediocre job. I would not recommend them if you have an important project",1
I received my work close to the deadline and with technical errors that cost me a client. I expect higher quality control and punctuality from this service and was disappointed.,1
The essay I had contracted the worker to translate into French was sent to me with part of the essay missing. Since it was submitted right before the deadline I did not have time to review it and did not realize the mistake. This impacted my business opportunity with a client. I would not recommend this worker.,1
This worker appeared to complete the task as required close to the deadline but since it was a translation I couldn't proofread and I used it at work and it was bad,1
"The work was ot up to par and is unacceptable. Do not recommend this person at all. Imagine my surprise when the work was not up to par, very disappointing and costly for business. I regret hiring this worker immensely.",1
"Assistant accepted work, but only presented essay in French one day before deadline; essay truncated with missing final statement. Impression given to client: poor; negative consequences.",1
The worker was not willing and able to complete the work that was needed done correctly. The worker showed a strong lack in her ability to complete a job given to her. Had the worker took the time to do the work and decided to start on it earlier than the worker might have done better. I do not recommend the worker as they did not meet the deadline and turned in incomplete work.,1
"This was done on time, but at the very last second, so we were not entirely happy with the timing of the delivery. Furthermore, our client no longer wants to do business with us because it was incomplete, and were were made to look incompetent.",0
The worker submitted the project just before the deadline and the end of the project does not appear to be completed.  More communication was key from worker if they were having problems or delayed in doing the work.,0
"Writer gave me the assignment very close to my deadline with little communication. Upon handing my assignment in to my teacher, I found that the essay was cut off, and incomplete. Terrible experience with this worker and would not recommend as I feel I cannot trust them. Very upset with my failing grade, especially considering the amount I paid....",1
"The work was done on time but was not done right and made me look bad with a project not finished and this leads me to believe that this person didn't spend the time looking over the project and was in to much of hurry and dose not care about the client at all and the work they do, so that leads be to believe that this person would not work out in the future for anymore project that I have and am warning other people if you use this person to double check before expecting and paying for work done by this person, this was poor work for someone that is business is to help people with their projects.",1
"I had a major issue with my translation and I may not be using this tool in the future ever again.  The issue I had with my translation service was that somehow the translation was totally incomplete. The end of the essay did not properly show up and I ended up giving it to a client without it being complete. As you can imagine, this was totally embarrassing for me and my company, now we have a client out there who has a bad opinion of us. This mistake has cost us a great deal of reputation that we will not likely be able to get back in any reasonable way.   I am not very sure that the mistake was made by the person who did the actual translation work or by the platform to which it was uploaded, but the mistake was done either way. I would certainly not recommend that you use this service since you may run into the same issue that I had, so make sure you have someone check for completeness if you end up deciding to go with them. ",1
"I was not satisfied with the quality of the work that this worker provided.  First of all, the work came in very close to the last minute.  Second, the work was not complete.  Since the work was not complete, it gave my client a bad impression of me.  This caused a bad relationship and a loss of business. I would not recommend using this worker.  I will not be using this worker as well. ",1
"The quality of the work was poor, especially near the end of the piece. The ending words were seemingly cut off and this resulted in a very important contract being terminated. Next time, hopefully, this worker is more prompt and attentive to detail.",1
"I was upset with the negative effect the French translation of the essay had on our client, but our systems, not the French translator were mainly to blame for cutting off the final sentence of the essay.",0
This worker was not very good. She translated a report to French but it turned out that it was not well written. A client of mine was disappointed in the report. I have to give her bad marks for this translation.,1
"The worker did the work, however, she did it shortly before it was due.  There was a grave mistake made, which made the entirety of the project seem flawed.  I would not recommend this worker for any other job I had.  I appreciate the time she took to do the project but she was not careful in making sure everything was 100% correct.",1
I would not recommend this free lance worker at all. Do yourself a favor and save your money and look for someone else. This person was very last minute with the request that I had given to them. They waited until one of the last days to submit the final product. Not only did they wait until the last minute the work was cut off at the end I am assuming by their program. This work that they did made me look like a fool in front of my customer and possibly lost me a very good deal. ,1
I had to use this service for a very important project. The work that this worker did was very flawed. They performed too close to the deadline. The work they produced was incomplete. This worker caused me to look like a fool in front of my clients.,1
"Poor skill, must avoid. Lack of responsibility. Not sure how dare such worker would like to make a living by such low skill. It is a nightmare to hire such a worker.",1
"I was hoping for quality work, but was disappointed as it appears the translator failed to complete the work provided.  As a result, I ended up with a negative impression being formed of myself by the client and taking a hit to the contract due to the poor work.  I will not be using this service again as it has cost me a great deal of business and I would suggest that this business not use this translator in the future as it may have continued negative impact on customers.  ",1
"This worker had good availability when I needed some translation work, but then finished the job almost at the deadline and cutoff some of the ending. I would not hire this worker again because of the lack of quality work. ",1
"I hired my worker to translate English to French as I know little to nothing about the French language. I had a bit of a short deadline as I wanted to get the information to a client of mine. When I received the finished work, I notice some of it may have been truncated. I do not know much about French so I just thought it must be somewhat normal. As it turned out, the translation was a mess and I actually lost some business as the result of the freelancers poor work. I would not hire this person again!!",1
"This gig worker turned their work in to me at the last second, hardly early. They also did a poor job of translating, and neglected the last parts of the translation. I lost business because of this worker. Although skilled, this worker's quality is very low, so if you've got something important you need done, just be warned now.",1
The worker is not skilled at translating properly. The translating errors were costly for me as they failed to meet the proper standards set forth in the job description. I would not recommend this worker for translation jobs that are detrimental as a misinterpretation can lead to dire consequences.,1
"This worker waited until the last possible minute to complete the work. Due to this, the work quality was poor and was incomplete. This cost me a client and negative consequences in my job for something I trusted and paid this person to complete.",1
"My worker could have done a better job, of course. I Understand that the deadline maybe was a bit cutthroat, but I would have appreciated more communication about what was going on, instead of meeting a surprise when the project was due. I feel that if the worker worked hard on this issue, they could easily prove themselves to be more competent. I do not necessarily question their skills at their craft, but more so their relationship with procrastination and communication. ",0
I am displeased with this translator because she waited until the last minute to submit to the client. Becausse of this it was impossible to check and make sure the entire document was translated. I will not usevthis person again.,0
"I recruited a worker to help me translate an article I wrote in English to French because I want to give it to an important client at work. The worker submitted the translation very close to the deadline. The translation appeared truncated at the end like as if the system had cut out the remaining words (even the last word written was cut off). Since I do not know French, I did not realize this until I was giving the essay to the client.  The incomplete essay resulted in the client having a bad impression of my work and deciding to limit the contract she has with my company. I am very upset and I was asked to give a review about the worker who translated my essay. I gave the worker a bad review.",1
"I was very upset to find the essay this worker translated for me was incomplete. It was turned in on time, but there were mistakes like words being cut off. I didn't have anyone review it, and gave it to my client who I subsequently lost business to.It was very embarrassing. I don't recommend!",1
I appreciated the work and the effort but there was an issue with the formatting which resulted in a loss of revenue. I think this greatly affects the quality of the work.,1
"While the project was submitted within the time frame, it appears that minimal if any effort was given to ensure that the submitted work was complete and correct.  The work was missing data, and it affected the final outcome.  Due to the lack of quality, the submitted work damaged a client relationship.",1
"Although xyz provided a timely response and the work appeared to be completed, it in fact was truncated invalidating the translation. As a result, I lost a valuable client.",1
I hired the translator for an important translation and the product delivered was sub par.  I ended up losing business because of it.  I would not recommend this service.,1
"All I needed was an essay translated into a different language. One would think this would be a pretty simple thing to do. I hired a “professional” translator and considered my needs taken care of. Boy, was I wrong. The translated essay was not even finished. The last written word was literally cut off mid-word. I was not told this information but I was charged the full amount. This project has been a disaster. This worker should be banned from the platform. ",1
"I am very disappointed about the work that this worker performed. They had submitted their assignment and I had assumed it was complete. However, upon submitting the assignment to my client I realized they had not completed the entire assignment. The client was disappointed and ultimately unsatisfied with my work. ",1
"The translator I hired turned in work that was incomplete, causing an important client to believe my commitment to her and my work for her was subpar.  This caused her to limit her business with me.  Getting this translation was more harmful than beneficial.",1
"Well, it seems that she delivered to close of the delivery and she didn´t even bother to read it to be sure that everything was ok. I don´t really like her work.",1
I had hired Alice to translate a document from English to French for me.  While she was quick to respond and completed the assignment I gave her I noticed that several words were not readable as they were cut off from the document and because I am not fluent in French I gave the document to the client not realizing there were many errors.  I was completely humiliated and had to seek elsewhere to get a proper translation.  Would not recommend.,1
"Although my worker has the skills to complete the work, my worker isn't very thorough since he/she doesn't double check his/her work. If my worker would double check his/her work then he/she would be more professional and successful.",1
She seems to be pretty well and a good writer. I would highly recommend her. I think she would be a good fit for the company. I would hire her on the spot. ,0
I found the worker to be quite disappointing. I expected the work to be done in a tiimely fashion and not so last minute. The fact the project was missing words and basically unfinished causing my loss of business is unacceptable and I would not recommend.,1
"The worker does a good job, but need to communicate with me better. I don't speak the language so I need to know about any problems before giving the work to the client. Other than that, I think this person does a great job and I would recommend them to anyone needing that kind of service. ",0
Had this worker complete a translation of an essay for one of my clients. The worker barely finished by my deadline and provided me with an incomplete product. Use caution when using this worker.,1
"I hired a worker to translate an article I wrote from English to French. The worker submitted the translation before the deadline, but it was poorly done. The translation was cut off, and the client I presented it to was not impressed. ",1
This worker should double checked her work before submitting the project. It's altogether possible this was a system error but she should submitted the work early instead of waiting until the end.,1
"I was very disappointed in this service.  I received the translation just before the deadline, so I didn't have time to check it.  It turned out that the end of the translation was cut off, rendering the result essentially useless.  It caused me embarrassment in a professional setting.  I will not use this service again.",1
"The worker was willing to translate the essay, but failed to do so correctly. Words were cut off, leaving the ending unfinished. This made me appear incompetent to my client. ",1
"You will have better luck finding a good translation if you search the internet. Poor quality, the translation was incomplete.  However, the worker did make the deadline",1
"I was extremely disappointed in the quality of work. Since I am not knowledgeable in the language of French, I relied on the skills of the worker. It the evident that the work was not verified nor even briefly reviewed before submitting it to me. I was embarrassed after submitting sub par work to my client. This resulted in me losing a huge part of my contract. I would warn potential client to avoid this worker.",1
The work was absolutely horrible and cost me a contract at my job! I am very dissapointed. The work was inaccurate and I could have done it better myself. What a shame. If you were not planning on doing the work that was asked of you then you should not have accepted my offer. Everyone should stay away from here if you want good work done for you.,1
this person is not dependable at all I will not recommend this person to anyone who needs this type of work I will be disciplining this person a writing a written complaint about this work to hire up in the company,1
"Received my final copy right at the end of the deadline, causing me to rush to turn it in and it wasn't finished! I turned this in to a higher up at my work who now thinks negatively of me because of this.",1
"This worker did a horrible job at translating my paper. Not only was the paper cut off of many words, This worker handed me the results at almost the end of my deadline. Not satisfied and not happy at all. Poor work quality all around and really just made my job harder. ",1
"While given a deadline, work was turned in just before it was needed. Quality of work was poor and incomplete. I would not recommend this worker given the circumstances of our work together.",1
The worker was simply incompetent. Her lack of oversight caused me to lose money. I would definitely not recommend this person for future projects. It is a risk I cannot afford to take again. ,1
"I had asked to do a assignment by a certain time, it was done on time but there was a problem with the work and because I didn't know the language I didn't catch it in time. This worker needs to check her work before submitting it, this was a bad outcome for me. I do not recommend worker because of the carelessness they have.",1
"This worker understood the task at hand, however they seemed to have an issue with time allocation as the ending of the document seemed to be rushed and truncated, so the project was technically incomplete. The document was not well received as the ending was not translated with care.",1
This worker provided subpar work that cause a client to greatly reduce their work with me. The worker submitted the work right at the deadline and did not even finish the translation. Since I do not speak the language I was unaware that the work was incomplete until it was handed to the client and they saw it. This worker's poor work reflected poorly on me and I will NEVER use them again.,1
The worker submitted an incomplete project very close to the deadline we had agreed on. This has caused my business monetary loss and stress and I cannot recommend them.,1
The work was clearly subpar and made me look bad at my place of employment. I wouldnt recommend their work and because of the problems it caused I would not leave positive feedback.,1
The worker used more than sufficient time (submitted work close to deadline). I was not told about the truncation issue and didn't know it since I don't know French. The worker had enough time to notice and correct. Worker takes too much time compared to the average time used.,1
My worker translation appeared truncated It appears that the system had cut of the remaining words. I didn't realize this until I was giving the essay to the client.  The incomplete essay resulted in the client having a bad impression of my work and deciding to limit the contract she has with my company.,0
"This worker did not provide a completed product.  The product was delivered just before the deadline, and it appeared to be incomplete.  I lost out on a major block of business due to this unsatisfactory product.",1
Although I appreciated the work and the availability of the person I have to admit I was a little disappointed by the end work that did. I felt the communication between me and the worker was minimal and the worker should have notified me about maybe not being able to translate or finish the work. And explained to me if they felt something was wrong with the finished product.,1
"The worker submitted at the last possible moment. Even then, the last part of the  letter was cut off. The worker is not very professional. There was no warning or communication of what was happening. ",1
"She apparently did not finish my translation, and the ending was truncated - the remainder of the essay was simply missing.   She did not advise me of this, and as a result I lost my client.",1
"The freelancer completed my project on time as promised, meeting the quick turnaround time. However, the translation was incomplete missing some key words, I'm not sure if it was because there was character limits or if it was human error. I would not rate this as high quality work. ",0
"I am disappointed that the translation was not completed completely.  There was plenty of time complete this time, but the worker did not finish the task and as a result my work was negatively impacted.  ",1
"I am willing to bet that this reviewer did indeed ""try"" to do their job but they gave a rather pitiful effort that resulted in errors which I was unable to notice as I do not speak French. This is unacceptable for someone who is hired to work as a translator. I could understand and give a pass to someone who wasn't a professional and was just doing it out of the kindness of their heart. But if your job is to translate French then you'd better do it correctly. ",1
Supposed to be fluent in English and French. Either you know the languages good enough to translate or not. Getting paid for translating means that you are good enough of a speaker/writer in both languages.,0
I was disappointed with the work that I received from this individual.  Some of the work didn't make sense to me or my customer.  The work was not complete in several ways including words that were truncated.  The last page was just cut off and my customer was very unhappy.  The worker did not deliver the paper in a timely manner.  I will not use this person again and do not recommend to others.,1
"I contact the free lancer, it was easy to reach.  The work contract was agreed upon smoothly.  however, the translator submit the work too late at the last minute, and this person seems to have missed the last few parts of the translation which affect my work, so it was negative in term of quality of work.",1
"I submitted an essay to be translated from English to French by this worker. They turned it in just before the deadline, and unfortunately, I found out later they left out the end of the article. It was like it had been cut off. This essay was going to a very important client I had at work. As a result of the worker's error, my client was left with a bad impression of me and doesn't want to do much work with my company. Avoid this translator if high quality work is important to you!",1
