The delivery was not at all aduquate.  They messed up my order and brought me food that I was allergic too.  I am very disappointed in the service they provided.  ,1
My delivery person did not check my order and the order was completely wrong for me. This should never have been delivered to me as is and it should have been checked.,1
The delivery person was professional and on time.  I do think though that the delivery people should double check the order before leaving the restaurant with said order.,1
She brought me food with an allergen in it and I was unable to eat because of that. Driver's really need to check orders before leaving the restaurant and delivering the food. ,1
I think that the delivery person may of handed me the wrong order.  What I got was completely different than from what I ordered.   I hope in the future this wont happen again. ,1
Bad experience ever happen in my life all day hungry .The food i ordered was not delivery by u is this your way of customer care. Once check all item is in ordered by the Clint  ,1
The delivery person was not very good. They messed up my order in a way that made it not let me have food for lunch because of their mistake. I would never use their service again.,1
It was a normal delivery although they didn't seem to order the food the way I asked them too. Not that big of a deal for me but I can't see myself using Grubhub anymore after this.,1
"I know it's probably the restaurant's fault and not the driver, but I'm mad that he didn't realize that the order was wrong. I had to throw the whole meal out and couldn't eat any of it.",1
"I am totally upset with the order, you are not all understood my order and this is worst delivery which i got in my life. I am allergic to peanet butter and you didnt offered me the good meal.",1
This deliverer was nice and all. I just hated that they didn't even have the decency to check and make sure my order was right before bringing it to me. I feel like that's part of the job too. ,1
"He was on time and I dont have complaint on his timing, but what have he checked while lifting the items for delivery. Should be not check with the ordered and to be delivered items in the bill. ",1
"The delivery person did not seem to care. The order was very badly destroyed, and the one reason I ordered it was ignored. The delivery person also took far too much time to deliver it, so it wound up late.",1
"The delivery person did not make sure that my order was correct before leaving the restaurant.  I had specified no peanut butter and my order contained peanut butter.  Due to my allergy, I could not eat the meal.",1
My delivery person did not check to make sure the food was as ordered before delivering it. They forgot to leave off the peanut butter spread so I was unable to eat it due to my nut allergy. Such a disappointment! ,1
The delivery person did not bring me the right item. I do not kind though cause I know those apps can be confusing and perhaps the app itself did not register the order in the way I intended. Oh well. I will live. ,1
"I was unable to get my order right. Half of the items were wasted because of this and the allergies I have. I wish that my driver would have checked the order, that is why I use the service in the first place. Useless.",1
"It is really a bitter experience with your delivery style. I will not say, that the delivery was late.  But you people have delivered some that of your choice and not what I have ordered. It seems you have done it deliberately.",1
This is my first time using the app.  I believe I was delivered the wrong meal.  It could of been a accident or it could of been incompetence.  I am unsure which it is but I got something totally different than what I ordered. ,1
I was very disappointed with this order.  My food was inedible and there was nothing that I could do.  I would not have food delivered again.  I think the delivery person should have checked my order to make sure that it was correct.,1
"I am very unhappy with my order. Although I got it on time, it was entirely wrong. I could not eat some items because they didn't follow my order directions and gave me the wrong one, and I'm allergic. The driver should have checked.",1
This person couldn't even check my order to make sure that it was right before bringing it to me. Everything was completely wrong and I have no way of getting a new meal because I spent the last of my money on this one. Horrible service. ,1
"This delivery person clearly does not care about the instructions given with orders. My food came without the main ingredient, which is the whole reason I wanted it, and it was covered in peanut butter when I specifically requested no peanut butter.",1
"I had some issues with my order and wish the delivery person had checked it to make sure it matched. However, they are ultimately not the one that made the mistake. The order was prompt, delivery person was nice and friendly, and everything went smoothly with them.",1
"The delivery person from Grub Hub did not do a good job.  I felt like that she was not attentive to the instructions that I provided.  My order was wrong on several different levels.  Consider a different delivery person when going Grub Hub, not one you can rely on.",1
I am pretty upset about my order. I specifically asked to not have peanut butter on it as I am allergic to peanuts. When I opened up my order it was covered in peanut butter. I am now out of cash and hungry :(. The delivery person obviously was not paying attention to orders!,1
"I was very displeased at the fact taht my food had peanut butter scattered all about. I am allergic and the driver seemed not to care that all this was splashed over my food. What might seem small to the delivery service is something actually quite big to me, and dangerous. I am upset. ",1
"The delivery person was careless. She should have checked to make sure that the order was prepared as ordered before delivering it. Even though the mistake with the order may not have been her fault, it is still her responsibility to verify that the delivery is what the customer ordered.",1
"So I got my order from today.  The food was timely and I got it in a reasonable manner.  However, the order was completely wrong.  I am not sure if the problem was hers or it was due to the place I ordered from, but I know as a former deliver person, you always check the order before you leave. ",1
"While my delivery person was on time and very courteous, my order arrived with a couple of major issues.  I wish that the delivery person would have verified that my order was correct before bringing it to me.  Now I have wasted my money on a meal that I canâ€™t eat because I am allergic to the ingredients.",1
"The meal was just completely ruined for me! My delivery person forgot a very important ingredient which was the whole reason I look forward to this specific meal. I also asked for no peanut spread because I'm very allergic with nuts, and the meal came full of peanut spread! I will never trust this service again.",1
"I used the delivery service Grubgrab and got the wrong meal. I think the driver should be checking the meal when it is picked up, just like I would before I drive home. I think that otherwise the dinner was delivered just fine. But next time I'll do a reminder that to check the meal and you might all want to do that too.",1
"The delivery person provided bad service. She delivered the order without checking that it had been prepared the way the customer ordered it. The mistake on the preparation was probably a mistake the chef or whoever prepared the order made, but the delivery person is at fault for not checking that the order was prepared correctly.",1
"The delivery was not what I wanted. I tried to tell the delivery person this, but they didn't seem the slightest bit interested in what I had to say. At the very least they should have apologized for messing the order up! No apology was offered. I am thoroughly disgusted with this service. Needless to say, I will not be using your service again. ",1
"This delivered meal was completely  wrong.  I am so upset and will not use this service again!  not only was my order wrong, but it came with a peanut spread, when I am allergic to nuts so I  could not eat the meal due to this, forcing me to go  the entire day without lunch.  I would never recommend them to any of my friends or colleagues at this point.  I'm very disappointed with the guy who delivered my order.",1
"I only have an allotted amount of time for lunch, so when I order lunch I can't afford it to have any mistakes! My order today had peanut butter in it which I am highly allergic to. To make matters worse, it was missing the one thing that I was really looking forward to eating and specifically ordered. I would never order from here again. Their delivery people obviously are careless and the company isn't concerned about us customers.",1
"Today I am very disappointed with the delivery to say the least. Although I can't completely blame the delivery driver since they didn't physically make the food, however I think it is their responsibility to check that they have picked up the correct food and to see if there are any errors to the best of their ability. My meal today wasn't slightly wrong - it was completely wrong! And now I am unable to even eat lunch today because of this.",1
"I am very upset with my service. First, I have allergies to peanuts and my food contained peanut butter - this is something that delivery drivers should check before delivering the food. They should always be checking that the food matches the order exactly, and thats even more important when allergies are involved. Second, it was missing the 1 item I was really looking forward to! Again, had the driver checked, I would have had my full meal. ",1
The delivery person brought my meal but it was the wrong meal. I would have preferred the delivery driver to check to make sure the correct meal was given up them to deliver. I understand mistakes can happen but I was unable to eat the meal due to an allergy and also it did not contain what I ordered. I had to go through the day without lunch because the driver was careless and did not check the order. I am very disappointed with this service.,1

I had to go through the day without lunch because the driver was careless and did not check the order. I am very disappointed with this service.,1
"My meal was completely messed up by the restaurant.  I'm allergic to nuts and asked for NO peanut spread - however my meal was covered in and and I cannot eat it at all.  I also ordered the special because I absolutely love this one ingredient in the dish - and they didn't even include that ingredient!  While the delivery person is not at fault, the restaurant definitely is!  And I think the delivery person should have checked my order before accepting it.",1
"I am not sure who is in charge of making sure that my meal is correct, but I feel as if the delivery person should of been able to put in their part to check my food. I am allergic to peanut butter and my meal was smeared with peanut butter. I also ordered from this specific restaurant because I wanted to get a very specific meal, but the meal came with out the ingredient that I wanted. I believe that the delivery person should make sure that meals are delivered accordingly.",1
"I am very unhappy with my experience today. I had ordered from this place for a specific ingredient and it was forgotten! I also specified no peanut butter, as I am allergic to nuts, and it came with peanut butter all over it! This is unacceptable. It is the responsibility of the deliver person to make sure they are delivering the right meal! This did not happen, and I could not eat any of the meal that I had paid for. So disappointed and angry at the incompetent delivery person, who brought me food, without checking it first, that I cannot eat! ",1
"While this is not the fault of the delivery person entirely, it still makes me quite angry that he/she did not double check my order, and so I ended up getting my food delivered without my favorite ingredient - which is why I ordered it in the first place! And to make matters worse, it came with peanut butter spread and I am ALLERGIC to nuts.  So, I ended up not being able to eat my meal and went without lunch altogether! By far the worst experience I have had with a delivery service platform in my entire life. I will not ever use again, nor do I recommend anyone using them! Awful experience. ",1
Everything was fine with the delivery person. It isn't their fault that my food was messed up. They did their job just fine as far as I am concerned. ,0
"The food was fucking atrocious. I've eaten ass that tasted better, but the driver was good. He was quick and polite which is all you can really expect.",0
Delivery person from Grubhub was pretty good. He arrived fairly fast and came to the front desk at my work. He confirmed my order and was very pleasant. ,0
I dint care of that .I am complaint about who preparation of the product which is the person will give the answer because of order knowledge is gone out  ,0
"The delivery person was fine. I want the person who prepared the meal fired. Take away their salary, put them in the poorhouse. It's the right thing to do.",0
He is good and delivered the meal on time. Very professional and pleased me with on time and the attitude was good with humor. I will strongly recommend him,0
I think the delivery person was fine and the delivery was prompt. Just the food was messed up. I would use the delivery person again as they are not to blame.,0
The irder i had made was delevired on time and the delivery person was nice and respectful. Nothing out of the ordinary to report on about the delivery itself,0
"The delivery person was average, no issues with them. There was nothing extraordinary or terrible about them. He was friendly as expected of a delivery driver.",0
"I got my order but it was not what I wanted. Not sure who to blame for that, but I guess the delivery was at least completed. There needs to be more oversight.",0
"Although my order was a mess, The delivery person got my food to me in a timely manner and was professional. I'm happy with the service of the delivery person. ",0
even though the person delivers the product on time.i would definitely consider the traffic for late delivery otherwise i would not satisfy for late delivery   ,0
I understand that there are few things which are not under the control of delivery person. I am rating delivery person high on delivery timing and respectfulness.,0
The delivery person arrived on time and was polite. I could not ask for more as far as the delivery service goes but the food aspect of my order was totally wrong.,0
"This delivery person was satisfactory. The food was not what I had asked for, but that wasn't his fault. He was on time and held up his end of the deal fairly well.",0
The delivery person was professional and he was on-time. But food was bad and my instructions were ignored. I could just say that the the delivery guy is not at fault.,0
"I got the order on time and he was friendly and nice. I would recommend this person to deliver the food to me again, did a great job at what he does. Very responsible.",0
"The driver was prompt and nice enough.  I would use them again.  I had no complaints with the driver per se, just the fact that my order was ruined by the restaurant. ",0
"This restaurant is so bad! The delivery person gave me the right food, but without the correct specifications. They also took my money, but I wasn't able to eat my meal!",0
The delivery person was prompt and nice.  I am happy with the service he provided and would be happy to have him deliver my food again.   He seems like a people person. ,0
The food was not good but the delivery person was respectful and did bring my order on time.  I was not happy with the whole process but that was not the driver's fault.,0
"The delivery person was on time and polite, which is really all one can ask for when it comes to delivery. The meal itself was terrible, but that was beyond his control.",0

My delivery person brought me my meal on time. They were very professional and did their job well. They did a good job and did everything that could be expected of them. ,0
What a prompt and great delivery person!  They were quick to get my food to me.  Once they were here they were so polite and gave correct change without a blink of an eye.,0
"The delivery person was very professional and I was pleased with them. They arrived on time and didn't keep me waiting in limbo for my order, which I very much appreciate. ",0
"Order was wrong and do to allergies could not even eat it. Lost money and didn't get to eat. Waste of money and time, would have been better off going to get the food myself.",0
"The delivery person was fine. They did their job, as expected and was on time with it. My neutral is due to the fact the order was messed up and inedible in its current form.",0
"yes my order is timely arrive, this man is a such good person, but restaurent who take my order that person is not good man. he also negleted person, he is not a son of a pig",0
"Although the order was not as I expected, or wanted, the person who delivered the meal was professional and cheerful. They also apologized for the error, which helped a little.",0
Food delivered on the time without delay. So delivery person is very respectful. and honor. He did job good and neat. If I receive same order on same time i will get more happy.,0
"The delivery person was respectful and on time. My order was all wrong and it wasn't his fault, but he told me he would do what he could to help fix it. No complaints about him!",0
"The food was fucking atrocious. I've eaten ass that tasted better, but the delivery driver was good. He was quick and polite. I will never order from the restaurant again though.",0
