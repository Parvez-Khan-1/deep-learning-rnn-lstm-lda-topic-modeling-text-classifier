"Driver is a piece of $#*!, kicked the smallest dog youve ever seen. Attempted to kick a second time.",1
Awful. Every time i wait an hour and a half. Won't be using again. Drivers take so long. Customer service is ok.,1
Driver never showed up. First time using service. Never again.  Now will take 3 days to get refund on my CC. Dont waste your time!!!,1
Kept getting updates that are order was delayed. The slap$#*! who delivered the order went to the wrong house. One and done with grubbhub.,1
We waited 2 hours to have food delivered. The restaurant called us after an hour to day the food had been ready but the driver never showed.,1
They wouldn't refund my meal that was never delivered because they couldn't contact their own driver... yeah. Happens more often than not with Grubhub.,1
"Pathetic place, they deliver wrong items and then abuse the customer  Grubhub does not take any action against these people.  please do not order via grubhub",1
"They forgot part of my meal and wouldn't go back and get it!  What kind of service is that?  With this level of service, I'm amazed they are still in business!",1
terrible service.  ordered and food not delivered.  can't find driver that was assigned.  put on hold for over an hour on the phone then.  still couldn't figure out what happened,1
"I have waited 3 hours for ONE MILKSHAKE. I have waited 2 hours for the wrong order. I have waited 2 hours for cold food, and for food that never came. Absolutely horrendous service.",1
It's just too unreliable. We once had a driver take our order no joke 10 times in the opposite direction of where we live and was well over 2 hours late before we had to cancel the order.,1
"We waited 2 hours for our food, and the order said it was delivered.when we called customer service they said the driver never got the order, yet it was marked as delivered. Don't wast your time with this company.",1
"The food went to the wrong hotel. I never got my food. Instead of giving me a refund, they gave me a ""credit"" for $27.11 that I have 2 weeks to use. In other words, I am going to eat the cost of that meal. Thanks?",1
"For the second day in a raw,I got my food almost after one hour and 45 min.  *cold food *missing items *not even an apology for the delay  I will never never use them and will never recommend it to anyone.stay away.",1
"Placed an order at 4:58PM. From the app (specifically, the feature where you can see the driver enroute), it appears that the driver (Lisa(?)) picked up my food, and then drive to a local casino.  I hope she enjoyed it.",1
Food takes a long time to arrive. The driver was rude and sexist. I ordered delivery and yet the driver wanted me to go find him and pick up the food. He was very condescending and got angry when I couldn't understand him.,1
"A grubhub driver damaged my car in a parking lot the damage was slight, just annoying. But not as annoying as the completely helpless response from grubhub. If they run their operations in the same fashion, I would run the other way",1
The driver claims he tried to deliver but never called nor rang the doorbell. Grunhub only offered us to return our money with no other compensation. They reached out to the driver and no response. Im deleting my account and the app.,1
"the driver went by house according to map, then drove all over the town for an hour, still no food! I chatted and texted. they apologized, gave me 5.00 coupon but still no food another hour later.. I cancelled the order after two hours.",1
Never got my food - driver claimed he couldn't find me and lost cell service...I live off of a Main Street in CT. Will NEVER use them again. In waited hours and ended up with no food. I get so angry every time I see the commercial on TV.,1
"I ordered food. It didn't arrive. I called to ask about it. They said the driver left it at the front desk of my hotel. I went to look , it was on the counter and I saw no less than 3 people look inside to see what it was. #nomoregrubhub",1
I ordered my food at 7:00 and had to cancel my order at 9:10 because the driver had problems with his car? This is a restaurant literally 15 minutes away from my house. A restaurant I might add that had the food ready at 7:30. Screw Grubhub.,1
"GrubHub, please teach your ignorant drivers how to use a call box outside of an apartment building. Find the name & press call. It is not rocket science. It defeats the purpose of DELIVERY if you have to come outside & meet the driver! Ridiculous & Ignorant.",1
we ordered our food and it said that it would be an hour so after about an hour and a half we tried to contact the company and they said it would arrive in the next 20 minutes but it never came then they tried to get into contact with the driver and we were unable.,1
"If I could, I'd give a 0. They screw up the order every time. 3 of the times they cancelled my order after making me wait 2 hours and the 3rd time the driver that was assigned to my order REFUSED to deliver my order! Customer service did nothing but give me a ""sorry""",1
The driver somehow missed half of my order when picking up then wouldn't go pick up the rest and deliver it. Missed my lunch period and wasted a bunch of time trying to get it straightened out. The only thing they offered was a half refund. This is absolutely unacceptable.,1
"Our delivery person lacked the know-how to deliver anything regarding value. The timing was way off. Please know your business before you take someone's money. Also note, if mistakes were please own up and pay up to make things right. A negative reviews is more than 1000 adds.",1
"Driver never showed up with 72.00 worth of food. They play games on the phone so don't even think calling customer service. I was told no refund, but luckily, my bank is reversing  charges. Wish I read the reviews before I downloaded the app that I deleted. Don't believe the hype.",1
All I know is $37.19 was stolen out of my bank account. Grub Hub. The telephone number went to Mexico then I was transferred to Chicago? They say they will 'investigate'? They have all the info already!! Nothing gets done. They took money out of my bank account. Theft and Fraud-Hub.,1
"The idea behind GrubHub is great, but the company itself is a total joke. We have ordered for our office MANY times and almost every time the food is later than expected and the order is ALWAYS wrong. Then we we call they don't even fix the order so some employees are left with nothing to eat.",1
"So I placed an order through Grub Hub, the driver never gave my drink & told the person I was on the phone with that she did. So basically its the drivers word over yours. Plus they didn't want to come down into the building. Don't pay tip till you get it at your door, the drivers tend to be lazy and rude.",1
"My food was left on the doorstep unknowingly for 45 minutes until I contacted customer support. When I went out I saw that birds were in it! I contacted customer support and they gave me $10 off my next order... Never again ordering from this company or their sister companies (Seamless, Eat24). #BOYCOTTGRUBHUB",1
4 times in row I have had issues with my food NOT BEING DELIVERED. Support over the phone left me on hold for more than 22 minutes just to tell me they couldnt find a manager and they would try to assign another driver because the previous one couldnt be found. DO NOT USE GRUB HUB AT ALL. WORST. SERVICE. EVER.,1
"Driver was lost when he was 5 min away,he called me and ask directions barely spoke any English , it took him 20 min and he throw out food at doorman .I tipped 20% and delivery fee.The delivery person was completely jerk. I didnt want touch the food,poor customer service and I will  never order from them again.",1
"My restaurant use their delivery service and it is horrible, never on time at least 1/2 an hour late and if a customer didn't leave a tip it will take dispatch an extra hour to find a driver, they charge 30% for bad service something need to change or UBEREATS will reap all the benefits. I will no longer use them.",1
"I received an order and the food was spilled inside the bag uneatable, so I notified grubhub, should have gotten a full refund instead got a 10.00 voucher that I used the following day at a different restaurant  turns out that restaurant doesn't deliver so I got an 8.'' refund instead   will never use this scam again",1
Food is over two hours late and not even a call from the driver. I have been a loyal grubhub customer and use them often in the past. This is unaccectable to not even call. Have been on hold for 30 minutes with customer service. Have yet to speak to a live person. Online chat is busy as well. Very bad customer service experience.,1
"I asked for paper plates, napkins, utensils, to text just before arriving because I have to use a walker. To meet me at the side (kit.) door. She gave my food to a neighbor sending near the street and drove off, and stated she already had her tip from my CC from online payment. No paper plates, napkins. Will never use Grubhub again.",1
"Had an account with them to deliver for my restaurant. Drivers or rude, non professional looking and most can hardly speak English . I spoke with account advisor several times with no solution to the problems. Door Dash is a lot better, friendlier and drivers look professional. also cheaoper to do business with and cheaper for customers.",1
"Wrong orders, always missing food, horrible customer service, takes 2 hours to get your food. Basically dont use grub hub. It would be faster to walk and you'd get what you ordered. Switching to uber eats, if they suck then I will uber my ass to the resteraunt my damn self and make sure it gets done how I want and then uber home. Good lord.",1
Twice I have used this service.  Twice I never received my orders.  Both times I was charged for them.  The drivers were to have delivered to two different addresses.  How interesting that both times they could not locate the address.  So I was told they gave the food to homeless people on the street.   Grub Hub is a scam.  Do not use them.,1
"Just ordered from Grub Hub for the first time.  It was delivered on time (by a very rude driver).  When we contacted Grub Hub via chat, it took some time for them to respond but basically said they would just refund us for the food that wasn't delivered.  No offer to deliver what they missed.  Won't even refund the delivery fee and 20% tip!!",1
"We received our food TWO HOURS late. The driver did call and state she would be there a few minutes past order time, but showed up an entire HOUR after. The restaurant receipt shows that our food was done at 5:40 and the worker arrived at 7:45. Our food was all very cold, and our ""iced tea"" was watered down without a single piece of ice. Unacceptable.",1
"I orders 1.5 hours in advance, grubhub sent an email claiming that the order was on it's way. 10 minutes later I received a call from the restaurant saying that the food was getting cold. I talked to 2 representatives from grubhub who said that they would call the driver and call me back. Neither kne ever did.    Horrible service,  liars, dont count on them!",1
Driver forgot my drink and blamed the restaurant; she told me to go back online with grubhub to deal with it. But she still got to keep her 20% tip. Grubhub also tacked on an additional fee that was not made aware to me at the time of my selection and purchase. It took them 6 days to respond to my inquiry only to blame the restaurant. I'll stick with UberEats.,1
"Do not, I repeat do not use their delivery service. They are awful. I use them today and because the driver couldn't find me my order was cancelled. When I called customer service They apologized and gave me a credit of more than what I spent, only to force me to pay out of my pocket more money because I had to order more food than I needed. Just a total nightmare.",1
"i can see why gruhub has a LOT of 1 stars; i pre-ordered at 12:30 for $87 for delivery at 6:15 for a party i was hosting.  after 2nd call to GH, they sent to driver 'ready to pickup' at 7:05!!!!!!  i didn't get my order until nearly 2-1/2 hours later!! food was cold, shocker there.   Won't ever use them again!!  everyone at my party also had bad things to say about GH.",1
"I placed an order on GrubHub for lunch.  When it arrived I realized that half of my other was missing.  Before I could catch the driver he was gone.  I called GrubHub to have the rest of my order delivered but the driver was ""unable"" to return and my 2 year old wasn't getting his lunch.  They only offered a refund which is not what I wanted.  Will never use them again.",1
Ordered food at 7:50pm estimated delivery of 8:40pm which was long for a Denny's a mile away.  Food arrived at 9:45pm an hour later than estimate.  Food was ice cold.  Found out after driver sped off I was missing one of my appetizers from the order.  Reached out to customer service and they offered a $10 coupon for my next order.  As if I would use this service again...,1
"I received my food 1.5 hours after I ordered it. The restaurant is 1.5 miles away from my work. I would have gotten my food faster if I walked. Driver was not apologetic, and customer service on the phone (when I called to inquire where my food is) was not either. When there are so many excellent food delivery companies around, I can't believe I wasted my time with this one.",1
"I ordered food and something was not delivered correctly.  That would not bother me.  But spent an hour and a half trying to get GrubHub to correct the problem at the end of which (an hour and a half later) they told me they would contact the restaurant to see if it would refund my money.  The WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE ever.  Was told a manager would call me back,  Still waiting.",1
"Orders aren't filled in order of being received. Drivers can chose which orders they want to fill and which ones they don't. We ordered Taco Bell that is 5 minutes from our house and after 2 hours and 2 times calling the company with no success, we canceled our order. They said we won't get our money back for 3-5 days. That's crooked as heck! Terrible company! Terrible Service!",1
"I don't know how GrubHub stays in business considering how often the screw up orders. This last time I ordered the driver went to the wrong address so they canceled my order because of a difference in ""mileage."" Hope the driver enjoyed eating my food! Completely ridiculous company with some of the worst customer service I have ever experienced. I've been treated better at the DMV.",1
"I've given Grubhub every opportunity. In more than a dozen orders, they have never gotten it exactly right once. Late, lost drivers, wrong orders, orders canceled after I've waited 90 minutes. And their pathetic attempts to make up for their goofs are borderline insulting. I'm out. I've placed my last order. If you want food, correct and on time, go elsewhere. These guys are the worst.",1
"I left the driver perfect instructions on how to get into the gate and they had my correct address. I missed the phone call from the driver and they left. So because the driver can't use GPS or type in a gate code correctly - Grubhub ""couln't give me a refund"" and seemed to care less about what happened.  ""Grrrreat"" customer service Grubhub. The customer is never right must be your motto.",1
"Ordered lunch at 10:15.  Delivery was for 11:15, 11:25.  By 11:50 - nothing.  App said still being prepared.  Had to chat with customer service, they called restaurant, said another 10 minutes.  15 minutes later getting a call from a driver asking if I could come get it, no parking.  Are you kidding me?  For lunch, ordered hours earlier, couldn't deliver or update - terrible.  Avoid this service.",1
"My daughter and I were home sick yesterday. She is 16. She started feeling better in the afternoon and ordered food via grubhub. The delivery was made however he started asking her inappropriate questions ...., her age, why wasnt she in school?  Thank goodness I was home and could step in however when I called Grubhub they said the delivery was from the restaurant ....  be careful in ordering food!!!!!",1
"The first time I tried Grubhub I ordered almost $40 worth of food and was delivered a tiny appetizer despite the receipt in the bag being correct, and was refunded only half the cost of my order. The drivers call my phone confused and lost every time, despite the detailed delivery instructions I provide on the website, like they haven't read it or don't know how to. Don't waste your money with Grubhub.",1
"Tried to order a pizza through Grub Hub. We never got the pizza. They goofed up our phone number. They claimed the pizza was delivered when it wasnt, then when their customer service was called for resolution, they refused to give a refund. the only thing that they would offer, was 2 separate gift certificates that could not be used together. Absolutely and Utterly ridiculous. Will never use Grub Hub EVER again.",1
"Drivers don't read or follow explicit delivery instructions. I am wheelchair-bound, so delivery instructions are critical. If food is left at the wrong place, I can't get it. Repeatedly, this has happened. Rather than get the driver back here ASAP to correct the delivery mess-up, the best Customer Service could offer was store credit. This is not satisfactory customer service. I'll never use them again... and neither should you.",1
I have never been so angry about an online order ever. This is an awful site and terrible service all together. I ordered my food and it only came to my door steps two hours later. Also there was food spilt and the food was cold. The order was completely messed up they put in all the wrong things. Cannot believe how awful this experience was. I truly wish i had read the reviews beforehand because then i would've spent my $52 elsewhere,1
"Used them two times both times  Late, wrong items ordered and cold. A winning combination. Don't use them get off your butt and get it yourself. Grubhub doesnt care about the customers or they would give some training to there subs/ delivery boys & girls. Both times the deliveries were done with people that didnt speak English. If you need some help Grubhub  I could help I run a fortune 500 company. Both times i received refund how are they making $$$$",1
"They put all the cold and hot food in 1 bag, my salad, ketchup and ranch was warm and my hot food was cold. Got a message saying it was leaving the restaurant, and would be here at a certain time, came 30 mins after it was suppose to be here. So not the restaurants fault cause I called them and they said thats how Grubhub does it, they put Hot and Cold food in the same bag and others have complained it wasnt on time. Sucky delivery method. Should have picked it up.",1
"When you pay over 50 dollars you expect to  at least receive your food. If I am a driver and they hand me a small bag from IHOP My first thought would be "" There has to be more "". It would only be common sense.  I gave a 20 percent tip for this? I will never opt in for a tip until it is deserved from now on. It seems  the driver is only concerned about their next order and not the one they are currently on.  I would add a photo of the food except I never received it.",1
"If I could give a negative number I would. The restaurant we ordered from is 0.4 miles from our house.   The food was cold & took nearly 25 minutes to get here. The driver was so rude. She called & wouldn't even speak with me. She hung up on me. FYI, my name was on the credit card & the phone she called. My son was outside waiting for the delivery.  I called the 800 number to complain, he was a useful as a box of rocks in quarry.  I wouldn't ever recommend GrubHub to anyone I know.",1
"I placed a schedule delivery for 9:15pm around 7pm and my order my never picked up from the restaurant. I called Grub Hub customer service and they stated that 5 drivers rejected the order probably because I didnt put a tip on the order. I told them that I give cash as a tip. I was told that they will try and find another driver and its already 10pm, restaurant is closed. So basically Grub Hub had to cancel my order. There should be an option to choose cash a tip. Horrible service!",1
This service is probally the worst there is. I ordered food 4 miles from my house and took an hour and a half. The driver had it in his car for almost an hour. When I called to find out what was going on I was constantly put on hold. When I asked for a supervisor I was told I could leave my number and get a call back in 24 hours or wait on the line for 5-10 minutes to speak to one. When I did speak to one there was no apology and she did not follow through on her promise. I would suggest Uber eats.,1
Nothing but a headache! Placed the order which was said tone delivered 20-30 minutes later. Received 2 notices of delays without explanation. After an hour called the restaurant and food had been ready for over 30 minutes but no driver pick up. Grubhub tried to blame the restaurant on the 3 call and promised delivery within another 15 minutes. Desert was made 9o minutes from ordering and it was wrong plus drinks missing. First and last order with them. Don't use them; business model doesn't work. Money wasted.,1
"Order was extremely late, never got a call it was on its way. Order was wrong, and we didn't get what we wanted. Called to get it figured out. Took over an hour on the phone to get it straightened out. They agreed to send a driver out to get our new food! Hours went by and we never got any food. Called them up again and customer service didn't do $#*! for us, even the second time around!  Never going back, don't give this junky site your business, they don't deserve another penny of your money!  Sincerely,  Disappointed",1
"I placed an order for our firm at 9:37 a.m. for a noon delivery. The order was ready at the restaurant at 11:50 a.m. and waiting for the driver. At 11:15, the order was still ready at the restaurant and waiting for the driver. I called GrubHub and they called the driver. They said she was very rude to them and they were really sorry - she was leaving the restaurant right then. My order place at 9:37 a.m. for noon delivery, arrived at 12:30. Grub Hub offered a $10 coupon for $60 worth of food to arrive late and only warm.",1
"Three times I've tried this service and three times I've been disappointed (in two different states so I can't blame the area that we're in). Twice my order has been so late that it was cold, soggy, and inedible and ultimately refunded by GrubHub. The restaurants have all be fine to work with (one actually called to let me know that the order had been waiting on the driver so long the kitchen decided to remake it) but the delivery drivers and the customer service staff are useless. I won't be giving them a fourth chance.",1
We place an order through Grub Hub and after more than an hour late and many phone calls to the restaurant we learned that the food was ready a half hour before but the Grub Hub driver hadn't shown up and never did. When we called Grub Hub to find out what was going on they HUNG UP on us. In the end we went and picked up our own food at the restaurant. If I owned a restaurant I'd hire my own drivers and FIRE Grub Hub. We will NEVER order through Grub Hub again after this experience. It's true: it doesn't get any worse than this!,1
"I GrubHub drivers calling me and when I don't answer they just leave with my food. Or, they call and then when they get to my front porch they bang with their fist on my door and ring the doorbell repeatedly. All I get from GrubHub when I call to complain is that I should put something in special instructions. But, that never works because no one reads it, apparently. There's another service in my town, although they charge a lot for delivery. But GrubHub is not worth the aggravation. And, they treat their employees lousy as well.",1
"They tried to get me into it after they acquired eat24. I actually really liked eat24...Well, they don't deliver on time and many times they don't even deliver your food. I've had horrible experiences raging from food taking 4 hours to deliver from 4 blocks away from me, to restaurants that give me food poisoning, drivers delivering only part of my items, to food that never arrives (x3). Why do I keep using it? Because they have restaurants that don't get delivered by doordash or postmates. Lately, I've been wondering it its worth it",1
"I have been very sick this week so my husband used them an hour ago to get us food from Hooters so we wouldnt have to leave the house. It took over an hour to get our food. The food was cold , we were missing several items, and when we called grub hub back they told us that they would not go pick it back but refund the money. I called the restaurant and told the lady what I was missing. The lady informed me that she did in fact put those missing items in my bag. Not sure who is to blame but I will NEVER use this horrible company again",1
The delivery driver calls waits for 5 minutes and then drives away. He did not come to the door and that's what I was waiting for. Isn't that apart of their job? I tried calling back to get customer service and their just as worse. Saying there's no way to give me my money back nor can they get in contact with the driver that just left with my order. When I finally tell the guy let me speak to a manager he then offers me a refund. It took 20 mins on the phone just to get a refund and it's going to take 3-5 business days not including the weekend (it's a Friday),1
"I find it disturbing that I am a loyal Grubhub customer and waited from an order placed at 6:15pm-7:41pm and still never received it the driver told customer service they dropped my order off at the office... there is no office I live in a house which means they took it to another house In my neighborhood, I think that's very very unprofessional. I deserve something more than a refund I am a pregnant mother of 2 who is on bed rest and relied on Grubhub to follow through with my order. I honestly feel like the driver ate my order. Smh  On Dec 12, 2018, at 7:41 PM",1
We ordered fast food from Chick-Fil-A. The driver arrived a hour and a half late. Our food was ice cold. When I called the Grubhub customer service line to complain I was offered a credit. It was obviously a lie as it has not appeared. None of this was Chick-fil-A's fault. It was all the worst EVER Grubhub service from the driver to whoever answers their customer service line. What a ridiculous encounter for a fast food place!!! We haven't ordered since. I'm not sure we will. I'm starting to realize this company doesn't care about their customers only the almighty dollar.,1
"We ordered from a local restaurant and the delivery time was approx. 45 min. to 1 hr. After checking the email receipt and clicking on ""Track Order"" we discovered the delivery time had been pushed up to 1hr 45 min to 2 hrs. We called the restaurant and were told the order was ready, GrubHub had been notified but their driver had never shown up. We called GrubHub and found they hadn't a clue what the situation was so we canceled the order and ate something else.  At least they canceled and refunded quickly, they must have had a lot of practice. We will NEVER use GrubHub again.",1
"I waited 3 hours for my order. Support Services game me a coupon for ""next time"" like there will be one. When the delivery man got here he was trying to ask what my apartment was hung up on me as I was telling him. (Keep in mind the order already has my address and apartment number on it) It was a simple sub from a fire house subs 6 minute drive a few blocks away. They messed up my order I simply asked for no tomatoes on the extra comments section for the order. I was really sick I could barely walk yet alone go driving. I figured i'd try an ordering service HORRIBLE experience.",1
"I have had at least 7 incorrect orders, 5 deliveries of cold food, and 9 deliveries that were 45 minutes or more past the projected delivery time. The drivers are lazy thugs. They all wear bedroom slippers and act like they are doing you a favor. Twice they walked away before I had hold of the bag while they turned to walk away talking on their phone. Food hit the pavement. Get your ass off the couch (if you can) and DO NOT PAY THESE FOOLS. Hell, I live in the ATL and one of these MOFO's is up for murder right now for shooting an unarmed Customer. Check the news in ATL 12/2018. 4 real.",1
I well never order from GrubHub again I never got my order or a refund I spent $53 on food I never got we waited for about a hour and called them they said the food should be here any minute 30 minutes go by so we received a text message that or food was delivered at 815pm but we never got the food so we called them back and they put us on hold for about 15 minutes they come back on the phone and tell us the driver went home for the night and we could not get a refund because the driver called us 3 time's and was outside we never got or food and can't get or money back im so mad and will never use GrubHub again,1
"Place order at 10:30am for a 12:15pm delivery.  Tracker said order was delivered at 12:04.  It was not.  Checked with IHOP and they stated that the order was picked up at 12:02pm.  Spent 30 minutes on live chat - and got no answer as they ""were trying to locate the driver.""  Called Live customer service.  Another 10 minutes on the phone.  Unable to reach driver.  Asked for a refund!!! As a diabetic eating at scheduled times is critical.  Wasted my entire lunch break track food I never got.  My blood sugars dropped to 59.  A friend ran and got me a coke and gave me a banana That she had not eaten.  Let's see if they issue refund!",1
I have been ordering with grubhub for years all over the country for work and personal. Tonight I started  ordering dinner at 615pm and at 710 the delivery driver brought me someone elses little order and I was feeding my whole sick family after working all day. Called them asap and by the time they got the restaurant said it was too late cause restaurant was closing in 20. Refunded my pay and gave me credit. So. I ordered from another restaurant and 70 minutes later they cancelled my order and not only did they only give me a $5 credit but by 940pm all restaurants were closed and I couldtn even order pizza.. will never use them again,1
Twice in one week!! I was hopeful I would get good service.  The driver took 45 minutes to drive 1 mile and called to ask me to meet them. Hmm - I paid for a delivery fee and tip! When I told them where to park they took an extra 15 minutes. So GrubHub gave me a $5.00 coupon. Tried again today.  Driver actually came to my office but after a 45 minute drive the food was cold and she brought the wrong food.  I let GrubHub know - they blamed the restaurant - and then said they would issue a refund for the missing food.  They do issue a refund - less the $5.00 coupon I used for previous bad service.  They can't seem to get their act together.  BUH-BYE Grubby GrubHub!,1
"Tried to use this app last week while on vacation in Las Vegas. Tracker told me my order was delivered only it wasn't. The driver told me it ""wasn't her problem"" and hung up on me. Really? Whose problem was it? Mine? No. I contacted grubhub directly and asked for a refund and was told they don't do that and could only give me a discount code even though I live in small town Idaho where Grubhub doesn't even exist, not that I'd use it again anyway. I just think a refund for a pretty expensive order that was never delivered should be an option and it's bs that it's not and that I was treated so rudely by the driver. Denise in Las Vegas should look for a different job. Awful experience.",1
"So my first use of grub hub was about 2 years ago and my food took over two hours to get to my location and the food was cold by then and not worth the money. So giving this food delivery site another chance about 4 months after the first time I ordered from Grub Hub I tried again. Once again it took forever to get food that arrived warm this time but since it took so long I did not give the driver a tip, and he was upset. So with me wanting to give this site a third chance I tried again a few months ago. And once again I was let down by very expensive prices to deliver food that shows up way late and barley warm. So Im officially done with Grub Hub, have them three chances and that was enough.",1
"I personally don't like nor do I trust using apps for food delivery; do the traditional way with calling the restaurant directly or pick up take out at the location. One of GrubHub's drivers never made it to the restaurant my husband and I ordered from, made us wait for over two hours: during that time my husband called the restaurant regarding our order, and then the driver claimed/updated the app that our food was delivered when it wasn't. My husband then called GrubHub and explained our situation and all we got was our money refunded. Personally I think after that situation we're owed a free meal paid by GrubHub, but I'd rather leave this review and spread the world to NEVER use this app or do business with GrubHub.",1
My food was an hour+ late the kid showed up stoned out of his mind. I'm pretty sure he picked up my food then when and got baked hence being so late.  The queso had been dumped all over my chips and due to being so late the chips were all soggy. the food was cold and the driver didn't even apologize just stared at me like he was expecting a cash tip which i paid with card so unfortunately I tipped him anyways which I wouldn't have. And all I got for almost a 30$ meal was a 5$ off coupon for food I didn't get to enjoy at all. In fact I ended up having to go get something to eat from the gas station. Not only will I not suggest GrubHub I will not be using it again this was the worst experience I have ever had with a delivery.,1
I am mother of a very active toddler . I work long hours and dont have time to come home and cook. I decided to trust my gut and order from food to be delivered from Grubhub. I placed my order and waited two hours  for my food. Come to find out the driver lied about delivering my food and I told the customer service team . I asked if they track their drivers they claim they do not they dont . I called the restaurant to see if anyone came but they never showed and my food sat there. I managed to scream my way to a refund . And the restaurant also said I had to pay in person for my food if I wanted it. So lesson learned Grubhub is the worst company around for food deliveries . I will never use their services again and I hope there corporate office gets this,1
"Delivery driver claimed to have attempted to make a delivery, he said the business looked closed. We are located in a building with several other businesses with a big sign that says our hours and to knock. Come to find out, the driver's for Grub Hub get to keep the food if it's not delivered! So why would they put forth effort to locate your business??   After this I called to get a refund, they told me they would email me with the coupon codes. Never received email. Called again to just refund my card and say forget it, they then said only credits can be issues since we missed the delivery...this delivery service ( I use that term loosely) is a joke! If we're going to be screwed over, we at least want to feel it!!!!!!!!!! We'll stick with Bite Squad from now on.",1
"Normally I would never right a review like this however Grubhub was so incompetent tonight that it boggles the mind. After I placed an order at 9 I received an email at 11:45 (an hour past expected delivery). It revealed not only was my order canceled BY GRUBHUB, not only were all of the restraunts in the area closed, BUT IN 3 HOURS A DRIVER NEVER PICKED UP THE ORDER. IT TOOK THEM 3 HOURS TO TELL ME THIS. I am litterally so  hungry RN and cant get food because this took so long. The worst thing is that I might view this as a one time issue except for the fact that THIS EXACT SAME THING HAS HAPPENED TWICE BEFORE.  A 5 dollar discount which expires in two months i not enough. I litterally did not eat tonight because of this companies incompitance and I am deleting the app.",1
I placed an order for pizza to be delivered to my daughters birthday party. I received email confirmation of delivery.  When I called the restaurant to confirm they did not have the order and told me the order would not be prepared in time. I had to re order and the driver was 45min. late  we had to go to a different restaurant to get pizza before the kids left the party. I received an email from grubhub stating it was their fault they did not send the order tot he restaurant and offered me a $10 gift card.  I had over $100 in pizza ordered they admitted to screwing up - no apology only a $10 gift card for my inconvenience.  Not worth the stress and hassle - call the restaurant  directly much easier.    Grubhub - great idea HORRIBLE business  and even worst customer service.,1
"I ordered from this site many times, even after they screwed up.  I was new to on;line delivery, and I was trying to be nice, and give them a chance to get their act together.  But they never did!  Each time, they got worse and worse, until I finally gave up on them.  Delivery was dog slow nearly every time.  The delivery people didn't speak English very well, and they would argue with you when you complained.  That didn't even do any good, because you couldn't understand half of what they were saying!  The first few times, the driver got lost, and I had to go online to a chat agent to correct the situation.  That even took time, because they were always busy with other customers.  I don't know who runs this company, but someone there needs a swift kick in the rear end!  These people are awful!",1
"I placed an order an hour prior to me taking my lunch at work. It was 12:15 p.m. The expected arrival time was 1:00 -1:10 p.m. I check around 1:00 p.m. on my order to see if it was on its way, and the order showed delivered!! I called GrubHub and the woman checked on the order for me, she could not locate the driver so I waited on the line and finally at 1:25 she said that she could not locate the driver, so she asked if I wanted to send another driver. I was about to hit my 6 hours at work and had to take my lunch asap so I told her I would pick the food up, and all she said was ""ok"" and hung up. I am not the type of person to ask for free meals or anything because I know what it is like to work in customer service, but I know when to offer a customer something when they have received very poor service!!",1
"I ordered dinner for myself while working at a motel. I put in the correct address for delivery (as I have done several times before without incident). Work got busy for a few minutes, and I was unable to check my phone. Within a 10 minute span, I had three missed calls and a missed text from Grub Hub, informing me that the driver was attempting to get a hold of me. Ok, thanks! So I called the customer service line to get in touch with my driver. They tell me the driver couldn't wait any longer so he left, and I was not entitled to a refund. I never saw a driver or person approach the lobby, so apparently this person tried to call, couldn't get through, and instead of coming up to the damn door of the address that was listed on the order, decided to just bail and, I guess, what, throw my food away? Sweet dude",1
"Yikes! This service is iffy.  Please use only when you've been drinking and cannot drive to pick up your own fast food.   Unfortunately the wait times are extremely long and the drivers are aggressive and apparently without proper gps?! (It took mine a 10 minute phone conversation & 35 minutes over the maximum expected delivery time to find me?!... I live in a very city-central location).   Called with my complaint (cold & late food that added onto my cell bill). The employee was great- very professional, kind and accommodating .. only reason I'm not trying to give this 0 stars!  Ordered again (2nd times' a charm?!) ... 2 hour wait from 3.4 miles away... I could literally walk and get my food in that time.   Done with this service. Please do not try to finangle this if your ordering lunch while at work..  ... you will not receive it in time.",1
"Customer service sucks, and the drivers don't care at all about your food (and in some cases, incomplete dinners were because the driver helped himself to some of it).  It is always unreasonably late, usually spilled or otherwise turned upside-down (one idiot driver actually took out a box from the bag that he had put in upside down, turned it right side up and handed it to me like it was no big deal).  I called grubhub and all they do is give you $5 off your next order.  I've gotten this same nonsense enough that I won't be spending that $5 credit through grubhub - it was a great idea, but their service and their drivers absolutely suck.  I always tipped very well (and paid up front when I paid for the food - not when it arrived, or I'd have ended up just handing out pennies and advice), and no matter what, the drivers just got worse and worse.",1
"After waiting for an hour, I called Jack in the Box to ask if my order was on it way. The woman said the order was ready, but that there wasn't a driver to deliver it. I waited for 10 minutes before I contacted customer service, only to waist 30 minutes on the line without reaching a customer service representative. I got frustrated and wanted to cancel the order, but I couldn't. I called my bank to see if I could cancel the order, but they said they couldn't. I spent 10 minutes searching on the web to see if there was a way to cancel the order. I finally called the restaurant again. The woman told me a driver had finally picked up the order, but that he wasn't pleasant. 15 minutes later, I received a ""Delivered"" confirmation. I got nothing. I am now on the phone trying to reach customer service. 10 mins later, and no answer. Do yourself a favor and delete this app.",1
"1. Order delivery time kept getting delayed.  2. Finally called restaurant, the order had been sitting ready for pickup for 25 minutes  3. The driver, Raida, then marks the order as delivered before it even arrived to me.  4. The burger and fries were room temp. Not even warm. Not the restaurant's fault  GrubHub kept pushing out the delivery window.  5. I first contacted customer service via chat with Omid. After explaining what happened, his only response was it arrived in the delivery window. He did not acknowledge that the delivery window kept getting pushed out by GrubHub, not the restaurant, and the dishonesty of the driver.  6. I then called Erickson, who was very courteous and offered to pass along the feedback and sent this coupon. Erickson was the only good part of my experience with GrubHub.  I will not use GrubHub and will recommend others to avoid as well.",1
"GrubHub is the worst. Ordered food from them, to find out an hour later that driver never made it on time and restaurant closed. Ok. No biggie. Just was trying to look for something else when restaurant called me that driver is finally there. Called GrubHub and begged them to please ask the driver to take that food and bring it to me. Driver never did. They said my order got cancel and driver have a right not to take it. So they gave me a ""free"" grub after this. Ok. Me after 2 hours of trying to eat-looking for something to spend that ""free"" code. But operantly their ""free"" is not free. Promo code only covers the food part but the taxes and delivery fee had to come from my packet. After everything I've been through last night-I just ordered Postmates. Finally ate my dinner 3 hours later. Never again. Grab hub can eat their ""free"" promo code. Disrespectful, awful customer service",1
"I've been waiting for two hours for food from a restaurant that is 10 minutes away. The last 3 times I've used GH it was the same thing. It always estimates delivery time in about an hour and a half, but then keeps pushing back the delivery time in twenty minute intervals. I have to call the restaurant every time and they always say, Oh its on it's way right now. There currently isn't any incentive to use this delivery service. There's a fee to use it, plus you have to tip the drivers, even though this driver is now an hour late, and they make you pay with credit card; you can't use cash. I could've walked to and from this restaurant by now. If I had known it would take two hours, I would've made other arrangements.   JUST received a call as I was typing this review saying that my order has been canceled because they couldn't find a delivery driver. JUST now telling me this. It's almost 11pm.   Do yourself a favor and don't use GH.",1
"Recently tried Grubhub in Greenville , SC. First try was Red Lobster and the order was missing sauces and was cold. We only live 15 minutes away. Grubhub support did nothing. Tried Ruby Tuesdays and the driver left a salad and all the sauces at the restaurant. Support line took 15 minutes to let me know they would contact the restaurant for a partial refund and unlike other services never offered to have a driver bring it. Like an idiot I tried for my last time. Ordered from Denny's and received confirmation but tracking never showed on app. Support once again was slow and none caring. 20 minutes later they said all was well and I would get the order in 30 minutes. The app now showed progress only to have it switch to cancelled 20 minutes later. No one ever explained why it was cancelled. They need better customer service, moving support back to the US may help cut the support time. Actually caring and appreciating customers would be another.",1
"Wednesday Night (10/11/17) I ordered food from a restaurant at 4:45 PM. I received a call from GrubHub at 5:45 (about 10 minutes after the original expected delivery time) and was told a driver had ""accidentally"" cleared the order, and that it was placed again, and I should receive my order by 6:15. I understand that accidents happen, so I didn't make a fuss about it.  However, 7:15  rolls around and I STILL do not have my food. I messaged them on their ""online chat"" and was told that someone was on their way with my food, and that it would be there shortly. I was also told that I'd be credited ""$10"". I waited until almost 8:00 and called again, only to be hung up. My driver FINALLY arrived at 8:25, and said she didn't even receive an alert of the order until 7:45. My pizza was ICE cold, and my salad was soggy.  I have never had an issue with them before this, but after waiting almost 4 HOURS for my food, I will not use them again. I am very disappointed in their lack of care or service.",1
"I thought I would try this door delivery and choose Grubhub.  I ordered with side sauces and salad dressing on side.  It arrived pretty fast and no wonder cuz the driver did not bother to check order for side sauces. I call Crack Shack they told me to call Grubhub.  I told him my salad was a hot one and by the time your driver brought dressing it would be cold.  He informed me ""Oh we won""t be sending anyone"".  The guy at Grubhub told me he had to check and call back.  When he called he said ""Well for the salad we will credit you back and for the dipping sauces for chicken we will give you 5.00 off next order"".  I laughed and said do you really think I will order again, that is a big NO!  And I already had a 5.00 off my next order because It was my first time.   So this is crap.  He was a jerk and how hard is it to check the order you are delivering!  No rocket Science.  These guys are the worst.  I drove for Postmates when they first started so I know the routine.  These guys were just bad all around.",1
"After waiting over an hour for nothing more than soup and salad, the driver NEVER SET FOOT out of his car. Instead, he called my phone(mind you my delivery instructions specifically state to RING BELL 1B) which for whatever reason didn't ring. The phone did buzz, but it was a text saying we are trying to deliver your order and can't reach you. I then go outside, see a car with hazards on and I'm yelling like an idiot from my doorway because I thought he would be outside the door. Instead, the car pulls away. Mind you, there is a very bright light over my door and giant letters with the address and a bell CLEARLY LABELED. It is a clear night, no rain and NO REASON WHATSOEVER to stay in your car instead of getting out and LOOKING with little effort for the address. What's worse than this???? A 10 minute wait for GrubHubs supposedly GREAT customer service over the phone only to have someone answer and HANG UP. People, get a clue, order from the restaurant and skip this horrible service or USE ANOTHER SERVICE.",1
"My driver arrived with one small bag and I knew right away that this was not my complete order. I looked inside and sure enough, it was only half of a very large order. I let him know right away and he explained (not so nicely) that it was against policy to drive back to the restaurant. I called customer service and sure enough, that IS their policy! The first person I spoke with over the phone insisted that *I* call the restaurant and go pick up the order myself! I hung up and called the next person and she also said their policy is to NOT check the bags to make sure an order is complete before leaving the restaurant, and they do NOT ever go back to re-deliver...but that if I really needed my order, that I can call the restaurant and go pick it up myself. Um...isn't that why I just paid you a whole bunch of money to deliver it?? Not only will they NOT refund you, they refuse to refund the delivery charge!!! Bad, bad business practice. Oh, but wait, they sent me a $5 off my next order of $20 or more coupon! Never again.",1
"We placed an order for Sushi at 2:45pm.  Delivery was out to arrive at our place at 3:40.  When I checked the status of my delivery at 3:45 via the ""Track Delivery"" option, the driver indicated she had delivered our food.  Instantly, I called customer service and spoke with a woman who did not understand English very well and was clearly reading from a screen.  She placed me on hold while she contacted the driver.  This took over 45 minutes.  Finally, she said the driver ""found the order in her car and will deliver it ASAP"".  NOOOOO, I don't want sushi that has been sitting in the car for over an hour.  And what was this ""she found it"".... why did she say it was delivered??? After another hour of going back and forth attempting to speak to a supervisor the deliverer came to our building attempting to deliver the food.  Of course we refused and requested a refund.  After another 45 minutes of talking with several individuals who were supposedly supervisors, we were connected with a kind gentleman who was apologetic.  We were on the phone for an entire 2 hours to get a mere refund.  Never again!",1
"Busy day at the office so I order some Indian food.  They say it will be here around 12:45.  Great.  At 1:00 I start thinking wow where is my food, I'm starving!  I track my order on the Grub Hub site, and wow it says it was delivered at 12:28.  I go up to the reception desk, nope, not there.  Receptionist calls down to the building lobby, no not there.  I call Grub Hub and she informs me that the driver tried calling my cell at 12:30 and because he didn't reach me (because, you know, I was busy at work) he decided not to deliver the order.  Because the point of ordering online and giving them my address to a building they can walk into and deliver stuff to is to make things MORE complicated and LESS convenient.   Oh, and they won't refund the money.  So I ask to talk to a supervisor and I'm currently on hold (it is now 1:20) and holding, and holding and holding.  I guess they don't want me talking to a supervisor.  So I'm leaving this review as well as reviews on every review site I can find and I'm disputing the transaction with my credit card.  Grub Hub gets a big middle finger for this one.",1
"I had such a horrible my experience on my most recent order and my last. I had conflicting information where one site said my order was still being made and another one saying it would be delivered over half an hour late. I used the chat to find out status and that was a joke!  After the person took an eternity checking into the status they told me the driver delivered my food to someone else. That was it. Not an I'm sorry (not until the very end), not a ""we're having it made again and will deliver it as soon as possible"", nothing. I was left an hour and a half after I ordered to figure out what I was now going to do for dinner for my family. And the chat person was useless. I thought bite squad was bad but this was the worst experience ever. I can never take this risk again so I cannot use GrubHub ever again. It's such a shame because I really don't like bite squad because they lie to their customers and I have proof of that. I guess I just go back to never ordering food online again.  And they had the nerve to send me a $10 credit. Seriously? $10 makes up for not having dinner for my family? NOT!",1
"0 Stars! I recently had ankle surgery and thought Grubhub would help my dilemma of getting food without having to venture out on crutches. I am so frustrated I couldn't take it any longer. I have placed 45 orders in just over 3 months. More than 2/3 of the orders have something wrong with them because of how they are handled by the drivers. They consistently throw the food around their cars, don't read the order notes, and shove the food at you when you arrive. The final straw was receiving my pizza and soup from CPK today that was stuffed sideways into their red delivery bags. The delivery guy was being driven around by someone else and spoke no English. He approached my door and opened the bag to have me remove it for him (most likely because he was afraid of the spilled food inside"" and looked at me like oh well when I questioned how is was being carried. The customer service rep sounded like a robot with repeating ""sorry for the inconvenience"" a hundred times and had no real care about the point I was making about the type of people that are working for them and representing them. Stay away like the plague!",1
"We placed an order through GrubHub for the KFC on Crater Road in Petersburg, VA because it is so close to us.  Not only was our order more than a half-hour late, but it was also incorrect. Instead of the 2 Diet Pepsi drinks I ordered, we received 1 regular Sprite-type beverage, which was definitely not good for my diabetic husband. Our chicken was wrong, and our sides were wrong or missing as well. In addition, our dessert order was non-existent. The driver was useless as far as customer service, as were the customer service people to whom I spoke on the phone. They were to replace and redeliver my order, but then they sent an email message refusing to do so, claiming that a restaurant that closes at 10 p.m. was closed at 8:02 p.m. This was completely unacceptable, and the only way to have satisfactorily fixed it was to have delivered our original order promptly and correctly, which they refused to do. They had plenty of time to have fixed it during the whole time period of this experience, yet they refused and resorted to lying about it. The fault lies with both KFC and GrubHub, and both had absolutely horrible customer service.",1
"This is the second time I have tried to order food with GrubHub. Both experiences were horrible to say the least. The first time the restaurant actually called me to see if I wanted to pick up the order myself because the driver never arrived. This time, my order delivery time got backed up 20 minutes because of the driver and they only delivered half of the order.   When I asked where the chips and drinks were the delivery person said I did not order them, even though the store had called to ask what chips I wanted since they did not have the kind I ordered. After fighting with me about if I actually ordered them or not she pulls out her phone and said look it just says sandwich. Guess what word was right next to the sandwich? COMBO! Sent her back to get the rest of my order. 25 minutes later she shows up with 3 bags of chips and 3 drinks that are watered down and half empty! I contacted Grubhub and they did not seem all too concerned about it. Basically a ""sorry about your luck"" attitude. DO NOT USE GRUBHUB! Any businesses out there considering using them for delivery - DON'T DO IT!! They will give you a bad reputation. I would give them a 0 if I could.",1
"This is how I found out that Grub Hub isn't a customer focused company. I ordered a dozen glazed kreme filled doughnuts from Krispy Kreme via Grub Hub. My contract is with Grub Hub at that point, not the restaurant. Yet when I recieved my food, late I might add. The doughnuts looked like they had been put through the ringer and four of the doughnuts didn't have any kreme in them at all. I  chatted with Grub Hub, spoke with two different agents and neither could get me a refund, this is after I provided picture proof as well. They said Krispy Kreme didn't want to give me my money back for not properly ensuring I got what I ordered. All they could offer is a dozen free doughnuts. Never mind the fact that we pay extra to get the food delivered to our door. Grub Hub said they couldn't offer a refund either with out the Restaurants approval. So when you do business with Grub Hub they're not guaranteeing you'll receive good service from the vendor you choose. They're not backing up their service with any type of refund policy for faulty orders. If the Restaurant says no, you're screwed. I'll never use them again and I'll never buy a Krispy Kreme doughnut as long as I live.",1
"First (and likely last) experience using GrubHub.  The delivery driver failed to reach me on my cell (he was 30 minutes ahead of schedule and so I did not have my phone on me); unfortunately, rather than walking up to door to deliver food (side note: I live in a standalone single family residence in a family-friendly neighborhood), he simply left.  When I called GrubHub to report the missing delivery, the rep was unable to reach the driver and offered to re-order my meal for a re-delivery.  Thirty minutes later, the restaurant called me directly to see if GrubHub was sending another driver to claim the order.  Confused that the rep hadn't dispatched another driver, I called GrubHub back to request a driver to pick up the ready food and was informed by another rep that they ""don't do that."" And nothing else -- no research to figure out the previous rep who assisted me to clarify what happened, no additional solution or assistance or offer to refund my money, nothing -- just awkward silence on their end of the phone.  Terrible customer service experience, and much more hassle than if I had just driven out to the restaurant -- which I ended up having to do anyway to feed my house full of guests.",1
"Order was late, completely wrong..completely wrong entrees AND missing items. The driver..umm not healthy we will say. Called and said ""I'm *** and I'm on my way with your food."" Took him 30 minutes to drive 1.5 miles apparently at 11:30 at night with no traffic. Husband drove the food back to Applebees (took my husband literally 3 minutes) . The guy that packed the food at Applebees was argumentative. The manager,however, was great and we actually felt bad for him. Clearly GrubHub is a huge problem for them and they are losing money hand over fist because of this shady company. Grub Hub...said they would ""figure out"" (when I said we were just returning the food their driver wouldn't) ""if they were going to do anything for us."" Not kidding. Quote. She put me on indefinite hold, hung up and never called back. So, they kept our $11 bucks for their service and we didn't demand a refund from Applebees because the manager tried real hard to make it right and clearly has suffered tremendous losses because of this sham company. This was my second and final try with GrubHub and companies like them. Yes, the first time was a disaster too as they sold us food for a restaurant that was closed for business.",1
"The foodler/GrubHub merger has been a disaster! Foodler never had such problems. The GH customer service can be great when the numerous problems pop up, but this week, it just took a nose-dive. Items left off of orders, surly drivers, fighting with and through GH customer service to get corrections made, promises of refunds lagging when they hadn't previously, courtesy discounts to compensate this regular customer for the overall bad night of service promised but not made good on. Even when I called to follow-up, it still did not reflect the promised email evidencing the courtesy discount, on top of the meager refund for the kid's meal that had missing items. By the time I fought them and got the items and promised refund and discount, (the latter verbally) I was spent and lost my appetite. It was like I went hunting and prepared and cooked my own food, which is not the point of ordering this expensive food. This is becoming an abomination that will have me looking for another food service. Too many days of bad food and/or service, with this week being the absolute worst. If you make a promise GH, keep it! Don't? That is called bad faith or worse, just bad business. I need to cut you off like a bad ex.",1
"I've used Grubhub since 2013. I've used it so often - especially from last year to this year. I order from it everyday, sometimes twice a day. And recently, I've specifically written in the ""additional instructions"" to come meet me at the parking garage. Some drivers have called me in the past to ask me if I could meet them at the front door instead, and in those cases, I went to the front door without any trouble. But today, this driver Amanda doesn't even call me and sends me a sing text saying ""I'm here with your food."" So I go to the parking garage, search for her, and then call her. She says she doesn't want to come to the garage. I tell her that because I did not bring my keys, I would have to go all the way up to 5th floor to get my keys and go back out to the front door if she didn't come to the garage. She still says she's not comfortable coming to the garage. So we hang up and she leaves with my food.   What a terrible service to a regular customer. Can't believe this is how they treat their top customers? I am pretty sure that I'm one of the customers that use Grubhub most often, and why am I getting this $#*!ty service? I am not taking the food, so take that 20 bucks. And I am never ordering from Grubhub again.",1
I was staying I had a hotel close by and thought I would order through GrubHub and I ordered from the treat restaurant a pizza and I added some fries with gravy because you need to do a minimum of $15 to get the discount on your first order.  About 15 minutes before my order was supposed to arrive I put my dogs away in a crate so they wouldnt bark when the guy came to the door. Sometimes people arrive early and I expected that might happen they gave a 10 minute window of the delivery time I waited and waited nobody ever showed up I had the dogs in their crate for over 40 minutes   Finally the guy called over a half hour late and I could barely understand his English. He was at the hotel walking around. That didnt make sense because its cold outside and why do you want to walk around with the food. When you want to take your car and drive to the room with the X ternal entrance?. He gave me the food and I thanked him he didnt apologize for being 30 minutes late I had no idea the food was cold once I was back in my room the pizza was freezing cold and the fries were cold too and fries with gravy are gross when theyre cold.  He didnt give me any plates or anything like that so I cant heat up the pizza in my hotel room  I dont think Ill ever order from them again,1
"Well, I have just had my second worst experience ordering from Grub Hub.  My first was a couple months ago when after 2 and a half hours I still did not receive my food.  I called Moe's and was told their tablet was down and they never received my order.  This time my delivery driver did not deliver my food because there was no parking on the street.  The food was not even returned to the store.  After multiple calls to Grub Hub who already had my money, they refunded $35.00 of my $35.68 order in the form of two promo emails.  One for $25.00 and the second for $10.00 which that I could use on a future order stating that since the driver attempted deliver they could not refund my money.  WHAT??? So I attempted to place my order again and when I went to check out, Grub Hub would only allow me to use one of the two promo codes which caused me to pay even more money for my food.  The restaurant called me upon receipt of my second order to ask if I received my food.  Nope.  I explained what happened and was informed that the driver never returned the food to them or let them know there was a problem with the delivery.  I also had a issue with Grub Hub a couple of weeks ago when their driver called and stated there was no parking and I needed to come outside and down the block to get my food from their car.",1
"Where do I even begin? I ordered my food at 9:15pm. My delivery time kept increasing, and increasing. Finally at 10:30 I called the restaurant. One of their employees answered and as soon as I said we were the grubhub order he knew exactly who we were. Our food was ready for pickup at 9:22. The driver never showed up. At 10:40, that same employee who is NOT affiliated with grubhub got in his car, on his own time, with his own gas money to bring us our food because he felt bad that we had waited so long. I began a customer care live chat immediately following, asking for a refund because grubhub literally did nothing to deserve our money. The restaurant was amazing, and ordering from grubhub made our experience horrendous, we didn't get our food in a timely manner, grubhub played no part in the delivery of the food, and now it is past 11:00 at night and we're finally about to have dinner. This has been horrible. The customer care person refused to refund us, which leads me to my next point of major irritation. We will have to file a credit card claim because grubhub can't even do the right thing and refund loyal customers. I will never use grubhub again and urge anyone who reads this to steer clear. Even the restaurant wants to be done with grubhub, and they will be vouching for me to my credit card company when I file my claim against grubhub.",1
"Awful experience! Order food at 7:05pm. Said estimated was 7:55pm -8:05pm. Nothing changed on my tracker called the restaurant at 8:15pm. The restaurant informed me my food was done awhile ago and simply no one picked it up. Then I called GrubHub customer service. She informed for what ever reason my driver left and I had no driver. And she just put another driver on route to pick up my food. I asked if there was anything she could do. She said she could give me a 10off for my next purchase. I asked if I could have it on this purchase I made now. She kept repeating ""we can give you a code for your next purchase"" I informed her that I rather have it on this purchase since I probably will not use GrubHub again. (Rather just pick up my food when it's warm then get cold food). She then said she could refund the tip I charged to my card. I said no to that.(why would I not tip, since it was a new driver) 10 mins go bye and guess what ?! I still didn't get a new driver. I did get a refund on the plus.  To sum it up I had to contact them to ask why my food wasn't delivered, but the restaurant made my food awhile ago. The said it's because I didn't have a driver.. makes me wonder if I didn't call would I haven't received my food or would I receive it 3 hours later or more ? Don't use GrubHub, your better off picking up your food yourself or using anything else but GrubHub. Unless you want cold food, possibly no driver delivering your food,BUT don't worry you 10 off your next purchase, because the first time experience wasn't bad enough",1
"I don't usually voice my opinion about things but they have gone too far and done nothing to help. I mean I guess I could thank them for the exercise I got from the run around they gave me. This is what I wrote to them and of course got no $#*!ing response. Hello, On Sept 2, 2017 i placed an order through grub hub to luna grill order #1617001691 totaling $25.16 on a card and was told it had been cancelled. I called the number attached to the email and was told that my order was cancelled due to the fact that the delivery driver had been in a minor car accident, so i placed another order elsewhere for more food. I was then delivered my original order from luna grill  after I was told it had been cancelled. I just wanted to make sure that I was not charged the $25.16 from luna grill, because I would. Ever have places a second order for food if i had not been told my original order had been cancelled. I hope this matter gets resolved in a timely manner.  I heard nothing in return and called back after the 3-5 business days. So I waited a little longer. Anyway, finally on my 4th attempt I was told that there was nothing that they could do and to go ahead and file fraudulent charges with my bank. What the actual $#*!?! So they charged me for food I never received and then did nothing but turn a blind eye. Pinchi tontos ($#*!ing idiots) I would have never placed a second order if it wasn't for them canceling my first one. But don't let my experience ruin it for u. Just make sure u really want that food before you place an order. I will never again, I'd rather get up with the worst cold and fever and drive to get whatever I need. $#*!ing grub hub!",1
"This was by far the worst experience I have ever had with any company. My coworkers and I ordered for lunch, which was to be delivered at 10:50. 11:10 came around and we called Grub Hub to find out what was going on with our order as we only get 30 minutes for lunch. The woman on the line was very rude and unconcerned. We informed her that our order said it was delivered and the delivery driver was nowhere to be found. After waiting on hold for 10+ minutes she got in touch with her driver and stated he could not find the office and had returned the food. How is it that it was delivered as the website said, when in reality they had taken it upon themselves to return it without calling or contacting us in any way. We noted specific directions on the notes on our order and also asked that the delivery driver contact us when he arrived. None of which happened. The lady offered for him to bring the food back, however refused to give any sort of refund or discount and this went on for over an hour, so the fries/burger/etc would have been cold by the time this happened. She refused to help and when asked for her manager she placed us on hold for 30+ minutes before we finally hung up and called back. The following representative was asked if she would be able to handle the situation or if we should speak to the manager as we did not want to repeat ourselves a 3rd time. She stated she could and then like the other rep was unable to do anything for us. The best the manager was able to do was give a refund and not ever deliver our food. So we all missed our lunches and as we work 10 hour days this is unacceptable. The drivers excuse was that he could ""not find us and was confused"" even though clear instructions were written on the order. I think it is unacceptable that no one attempted to contact us that the food was returned and that he marked delivered which is a blatant lie. We will NEVER use this service again in the future. I do not recommend Grub Hub to anyone.",1
"This is the first time ever I've used GrubHub, and I'll be damned if it is not the last time, as well.  Typically I just find local restaurants with a delivery option, but since I was craving some gyros and there weren't any delivery choices nearby, I decide to go with GrubHub.  I would've never made that mistake if I wasn't very hungry.  At first it seemed  all cool- the order was placed, there was a spot for any special instructions, and I got a cute confirmation text right away.  The only thing that bugged me right away was a mandatory tip (I prefer to give out cash tips), but whatever.  So far, so good.  Then the trouble started.  Estimated delivery time was about 1 hour from order time, then as the delivery time approached, it was delayed for another hour!  Meanwhile, the online ""tracking status""  showed that the food wasn't prepared yet, which is really weird for gyros. At this point I called the restaurant to see what's going on, and they told me the food was prepared a while ago, but the driver hasn't showed up yet, and asked me if I want to cancel the order since the food would definitely get cold upon delivery.  I decided to keep it since I was still very hungry.  Then I called GrubHub, twice.  The first time a lady who couldn't care less replied that ""there's nothing they can do about it, and no refund can be given whatsoever"".  I hung up and called back again.  This time, a guy who seemed to be frustrated with the entire company he was working for, said that the best they could do is give us a GrubHub discount/credit.  That wasn't much of a solace, since at this point I was determined not to use them ever again, but at least he tried.  Finally, after another cheerful update notifying me that the food is on the way, I received a phone call from the driver saying he was downstairs.  By the time I got it, the food definitely was cold; also, the ""special instructions"" note was mysteriously ignored-  I asked for no pita, but it was still included, and the sauce wasn't on the side as requested.  Of course it could've been the cooks who messed up the order, but judging from all the other reviews, it must be GrubHub that didn't forward the order properly.  So yeah, unfortunately what sounded like a great idea in theory (delivering food from restaurants that don't have their own delivery service to hungry customers) turned out to be a disaster in real life.  Stay away unless you enjoy delayed, overpriced, cold food and crappy customer service!  P.S. I'm surprised nobody got sued yet for food poisoning because of severely delayed food.",1
"I've tried it twice so far, and it failed to make it to the door both times, even though I paid for it.",0
Don't use this service. They're customer sets is bad and do not know what they are doing! Use uber eats,0
"They never delivered by food... Also, I'm a diabetic, so that didn't help. Will never use this app ever again",0
GrubHub delivery from Alibaba took two hours and the food was soggy and cold.  The poor ratings are well-deserved.,0
They have one restraint near me It's sucks  Llllllokjjjhbffvvvccc.   Cccfyhnvvvvvvvbggghhyyyytgvggggghhbbbbbvvggggv,0
Wouldnt refund or redeliver. They suck. Over it. Use another vendor!!! Waste of money and time. Thanks for nothing.,0
"If you goto order food, they will show you pictures of one thing, put something else on your order and refuse to fix it.",0
This is expensive and a worthless service. They came to my house with cold food 2.5 HOURS AFTER I ordered.  Never again!,0
Horrible ... Ordered from 2 places ... The first didn't get it and the second doesn't deliver past the time I ordered....,0
Order was canceled 40 minutes after it was suppose to be done. Then said they tried to call but no one answered. BULL$#*!!,0
Id rather give ZERO STARS! NEVER ORDER THRU THEM THEY HAVE THE WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE IN THE ENTIRE WORLD!! I MEAN THE WORST!!!,0
I ordered my food 2 hours ago and I still haven't received my food. Even worse than that Customer Service won't answer my calls.,0
Terrible service. Food is never on time and always cold. And when you call to complain they dont care and dont do anything to help.,0
$35 pizza arrived 1/2 hr. late and cold.  This is my first and last order from Grub Hub.  My $35 pizza arrived 1/2 hr. late and cold!!!,0
"I can not tell you how many problems I have had with them, I will not go into all the problems it would take forever. Use another service.",0
"My order wasnt delivered but cancelled after one hour. I was so hungry. They had made me wait an hour, to tell me they cancelled the order.",0
Grubhub is the worst app ever !! The prices always change and coustmer service sucks ! Please bring back order up ! Do not order from grub hub,0
"I ordered food only to be told and hour later there were no drivers in my area to deliver what I ordered. Oh, after I've was already charged of course.",0
Ordered twice no food both times after waiting 2 hours for each order.They tell you your order is on the way then hours later tell you it's not coming.,0
Bad customer service only refunded food to reorder what they messed up on. More delivery feed and tip and tax just to get the correct items. Never again!!!!,0
Order delivery estimate was 45-55 minutes. Right!!! Try two frigging hours. I can say I tried this service twice... my first and last at the same time. FAIL,0
had issue with my order called customer service very  rude non speaking agents the agent hang up on me called 2nd time the guy was very rude and also hung up,0
"In my wildest dreams, I could not imagine a worse company or crappier customer service.  Don't waste your time or Money. I could go on and on.. Just STAY AWAY.",0
Delivered 1 of 2 meals.  Customer service obviously outsourced overseas.  30 minutes to get a refund of the missing items and tip.  No refund on delivery charge.,0
"The worst experience ordering, customer service. This is what I paid for. This is a scam business. Really hoping gradhub go out of business. They should not exist.",0
crown friend chicken in hicksville $#*!ing sent a boc of chicken and fries with a dead roach in it and grub hub said they cant help with refund.... $#*! all you $#*!s,0
"I don't use grub hub because back when it was delivered dish I'd always get the wrong order. I used is yesterday because I was sick, and of course wrong order once again!",0
"This place Sucks! I left a million Texted messages about my gate code and everything els, was the biggest WASTE OF MY TIME 8:12 TO 10:30 and called 3 times that was BS...",0
PAid 50$ for pizza. waited 5 hours and it never showed up. grub hub told me they would not give me a refund because i was not willing to wait for the food to be delivered!,0
Food never showed.  Called customer service 21 min ago to reach a resolution; still haven't spoken with anyone just listening to some awful piano music.  This is bull$#*!.,0
"We ordered at 10:16, 12:30 food never came.   Refused to offer refund and said they would assign a new drive to bring me my 2 hour old food. Will never EVER use them again.",0
"Doesn't even deserve one star! Two hours I waited only for them to text me the notification that they cancelled my order. DONT WASTE YOUR TIME, use Doordash or postmates app.",0
Second time that happens in the same month. First time I didnt even get a refund. The second time after two and half hours of haggling I finally got me a refund. In theory...,0
according to the website it was actually going to take 3 hours. The restaurant is 3 miles away and closes before I would have gotten my food. I will NEVER use grub hub again.,0
"This is the worst way to get food, Im finding out the hard way. 2 hours since my food was promised and still nothing. The restaurant did their part and now the food is wasted.",0
"Worst company ever. Took my order, made me wait for 3 hours and then cancel it without notice, no reason. No one could give me an answer. Anyway, first and last time using it.",0
Wish I had read the reviews before they took my credit card and other info and charged me for an order that they claim I never made. Liars and thieves Id rate minus 10 if I could,0
"I ordered from Grubhub and the restaurant cancelled the order.  Yet, the credit card was still charged and every time I tried to contact them to get it revised I was ignored.  Scam",0
"used grub hub twice. both times the order was delivered over 45 minutes late, after my lunch was over. food was cold and gross. ended up throwing it all away. Do not waste your time...",0
Grub Hub is unreliable. This is just one particular bad experience of many. I ordered food 3 hours ago and it shows delivered but i have no food. the restraunt is one mile from my house.,0
"I order lrge catfish dinner. The food was warm. I didn't receive any hot sauce or  mild sauce,bread or,.napkins, Will not order from them again. Sharks fish and chicken on Madison in cggo.",0
They got my order wrong was ice cold when it got to me I would never use this app again and for the money I spent I should be able to enjoy my food but nothing good about this food app.....,0
Placed an order in the afternoon for a dinner delivery from KFC. Ten minutes before it was expected we got an email stating that the order was cancled and to expect our refund in a few days!,0
Grubhub have recently been having trouble with payments: unprocessable.  I called customer service and they said use another card.  I contacted my bank and there is nothing wrong with my card.,0
Great idea but works terribly. Probably nothing against the company but it takes an hour and a half and is always cold and costs $25 for a cheap meal. Just not worth it unless you are starving.,0
never got our food.  Time of delivery kept extending.... the excuse.... no drivers...wtf people... you are a delivery service with no drivers!?!? Don't have drivers then don't take orders morons!,0
"going on 2 hours and 13 minutes and still waiting. The place is less than 2 miles away, does it take grubhub an hour a mile? worst service ever. first and last time I ever use grubhub never again.",0
This is a ridiculously long amount of time to wait for food...restaurants were closing as I was still waiting and didn't have any other arrangements for food that night.  It's a terrible experience.,0
Bad customer service it takes about a hour and a half to get your food just for the order to be wrong missing items no one is held accountable and grub hub still has not refunded me my money Grub hub is,0
Food never arrives on time. Frequently have to wait 30-60minutes extra for food to arrive. Only worth using if you are dead set on ordering from a restaurant that only offers free delivery through Grub Hub.,0
"Do not use this service! They are a ripoff and do not care about the customer. They grab your money and go, that's what they're good at. Do not deliver, will not refund and lies to you. DO NOT USE EVER!!!!!!",0
On 4 separate occasions Grubhub has canceled my order without  notification. The they have the audacity to try and compensate me with$5! Its always an issue with them. I will not be using Grubhunb ever again.,0
"They canceled my order after 2 hours.. I swear if there were zero star, I would give it to them. Why making me wait then say  oh sorry we dont know what happened And their customer service take forever to answer",0
"If you like your food to sit at the restraunt only to never be picked up, then grubhub is for you. I ordered some Mongolian grill but I got Ethepoian food, aka, nothing. They can eat a flaming bag of babboon $#*!s.",0
"You mother$#*!ers need to be shut downnn!!!! My promo code never works, even as a new user. If your intentions is to make me paying for food more than what I originally do then I don't need your $#*!KIING HELP!!!!!",0
"Food arrived an hour late and very cold. I paid $33 for the order, and they gave me a coupon for $7. Their CS agent logged out of the chat before checking if I was done talking. Super rude. They just lost a client.",0
"I waited over 2.5 hours and still did not receive my food, finally called and canceled the order. This was not a fluke, since it happened 3 times in a row within a few weeks. This company will go belly-up very soon.",0
"I ordered food from their site, the restaurant didn't have what I ordered, they waited 30 minutes to call me to tell me they didn't have what I ordered. so they cancelled my order after 30 MINUTES ARE YOU KIDDING ME",0
I have tried Grub Hub and not happy at all.  Either restaurant is no longer affiliated but is on the site. Takes your money and then cancels.  Next try waiting 2 hours for delivery.  Unacceptable.  Will not use again.,0
Customer service refused to refund a delivery fee for food I did not recieve and refused to send a driver to deliver the food I paid for but never received.. So I lost money on on an order in which I did nothing wrong.,0
I have ordered from them three times now. First time- the restaurant didnt get the order and the last order half my order wasnt delivered. They forgot items out of my meals. The price is to high for this lousy service.,0
"Absolute garbage customer service. Was threatened, and got many copy and paste texts when I had a question about something. They also tried to cut me off many times short and kept repeating the same thing over and over.",0
"When I placed the order it said 30 minutes.  Then it changed to over an hour. It's only 4 miles from where I am, but I'm in a semi and can't go just anywhere.  And I'm on a schedule.  I don't recommend this service at all.",0
GrubHub and its competitors are way too expensive and frankly not worth it . I go with beyond menu they charge $1 delivery fee and then I tip the driver the only problem is they don't have a whole lot of restaurants just yet.,0
Tried to use grub hub 3x in the last month and EVERY SINGLE TIME the orders keep getting pushed back over and over and over and over again. If you don't mind waiting almost two hours for cold food go ahead and waste your money.,0
Ordered my first and last meal with GrubHub today.  Didn't get my food but I was charged and they refuse to refund me.  Basically what everyone else is saying.   Please take our advice and stick to UberEats or regular delivery.,0
I used their service until they spoke out with political partisanship. Never again. There are other services like Skip the Dishes that provide the same thing and don't succumb to politics. Look it up and make your own judgment.,0
"Food that never arrives, customer service that runs you in circles without ever addressing your problems, and the best they are willing to offer in compensation is an apology. If I could give zero stars you can bet that I would.",0
"Don't use it. Even restaurants owner.They turn your restaurant off whenever they want. Their only answers are just ""I don't know "" OR "" not enough delivery guys""  If you like the food from other restaurants directly call to them.",0
Their customer service is beyond ridiculous. I waited over two hours to be told that no one was dispatched. They offered me 10 whole dollars fire my $40 order that ended up being cancelled. Will never do business with them again.,0
"Order was supposed to be delivered by 10:30 ended up getting my food at 11:30.. An hour later. Food was cold: Wings, fries and chicken tenders from Buffalo Wild wings. Dinner sucked and I paid $75 for it. NEVER will I use grub hub again.",0
"It doesn't matter whether the restaurant is at fault on your order, they do nothing to compensate you all; they have a $10 min on orders, before tax, so if a part of your order is screwed and it costs less than that, don't expect to eat.",0
"restaurant directly, I got a really nasty guy who said that he called me when he did not.  I went online to try to get grubhub involved and they were completely useless. The food arrived late and cold and grubhub was not concerned at all.",0
Stay away from grub hub if you order through them and the restaurant cancels the order they claim they will refund your money but they won't I still have not received my money for my order they still owe me so beware of this crooked company,0
"After taking $40 for $16 worth of burritos they simply never showed up despite a confirmation of recept on their stupid website tracker. Can't offer a refund until they talk to the store, which can't happen until next week. Thaaaanks, Grubhub",0
"I called after two orders were canceled and guess what, GrubHub offered me a five dollar credit and the guy on the phone sounded like a robot like he didn't care at all and that it was something so common for them that they're just used to it.",0
"They make false claims of offers, sending emails and push notifications and then will not honor them at checkout. They have done this multiple times and it demonstrates unethical advertising practices, including but not limited to bait & switch.",0
It is horrible i want to buy one thing for nine dollars and i have to spend 18 or more just to proceed to checkout i cant even get a sandwich for 9 dollars you are forced to pay a minimum balance of 18 if you go below you cant proceed to checkout,0
"After waiting an hour for my food delivery, the company sent me a text telling me that my order was cancelled. I called their customer service and they stated they didn't have anyone to deliver the food in my area. LOL What a bunch of idiots......",0
"Have used grubhub twice, over both orders we have been shorted over 50 dollars worth of food, the second time we ordered the food was completely mixed up, half of what i wanted in half of what my wife wanted. Feel like i have been robbed... twice.",0
"Placed an order, waiting over an hour for delivery.  Called the restaurant to see if it had been picked up and was told it had been canceled 45 minutes earlier.  I didn't cancel it, Grub Hub did without any notification.  I know not to use them now.",0
Waited an hour despite being quoted 35-45 minutes. Called. Was told I would be compensated and order would arrive within half an hour. It never did. Got a text 15 mins later to inform me my order was cancelled. Restaurants now closed. They're awful.,0
"Ordered taco bell, $#*! was a hour late. After I called for a refund I called my bank card and they took out more money than what they were supposed to. Tf I will never order from punk ass slow ass grub hub again . And I would not reccommend to anybody",0
I wish I had read these before I ordered - they are disgusting. If you order from Grubhub - be sure you understand you may or may not get your order - they are clueless. I also wouldn't trust that the food is fresh - will never order through them again.,0
I will never use GrubHub again.  Twice already they pushed my order delivery time 1.5 hours past the original delivery time.  Called customer service was on hold for over 20 minutes.  I don't understand how a company survivors with this awful of service!!!,0
"Site doesn't work, login doesn't work, tried every login option. First and last time I'll attempt to order thru grubhub. Oh and ""connect with us"" doesn't have any contact info. Waste of time. I am tech savvy and this site just does not work. Look elsewhere.",0
I used for a work function in Portland OR--food was over 1.5 hrs late.  Tried tonite in AZ ordered at 7:26 with eta of 8:25-8:35.  Got a nice little text at 8:47 that order had been delivered when in fact it had not.  Never again my friend do not recommend!,0
"if only there were a rating of -1. i cannot think of one occasion where i received an order from grubhub without some sort of complication. i guess jokes on me for continuing to use this app. NEVER AGAIN. worst customer service i've ever received, hands down.",0
"THE WORST - the absolute worst.  They FREQUENTLY cancel orders AFTER you've waited an hour and longer for food.  It's absolutely ridiculous.  And then they give you a ""discount"" on your NEXT ORDER.   Forget it - I'm Uber Eats all the way.  Screw you Grub Hub.",0
"I hate GrubHub so incredibly much. I wish restaurants didn't require customers to use it. I've been fighting with this website for 45 minutes! I'm now looking for a different place to get food. I gave 1 star because zero wasn't an option. GrubHub, I HATE you.",0
Bad service ....tried 2 x and orders were canceled !  Crampy !  X. Cr happycr happy etc etc etc and 100 more ltrs xXxX.   Xxx x just crappy etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc and c,0
Food cold!!  Took forever!!  Only received a small part of the order.  When I told the driver he said there was nothing he could do and left.  Called customer service.  They would not give me a full refund even though two people in my house will not have dinner.,0
"Horrible customer service. Consistently gets orders wrong, including missing items, then refuses to refund. Apparently, GrubHub thinks it has the right to take a customer's money, regardless of whether it upholds its end of the bargain. Not cool. Not cool at all.",0
"Its been waiting 2 hours since Ive placed my order and Im still waiting for my Food to be delivered (from 15 mins away). Im confused???? I could have walked there, got food and eaten it in a faster time. This is my first experience with grubhub and I am NOT HAPPY.",0
"They take your money they dont deliver the food and they wait over an hour or more to cancel. Then they lie and say the restaurant was closed when obviously that is completely false. I have 3 refunds that I havent received yet. They are incompetent, liars. Beware!!",0
"Placed my order through grub hub and 45 minutes later they emailed me that it was cancelled!! By that time, it was too late to place a new order (9pm) and this has happened to me 3 times before, but tonight got me fuming!! I'm done with Grub hub! No more chances for you.",0
"Used twice.   First time over an hour late.   Second time,  never arrived.   Recieved call from grubhub 2 hours after I placed the order saying that there was a mix up and that the driver hadn't even left the restaurant.   Canceled the order and will never use grubhub again.",0
"I just ordered through Grub Hub again and this time it wasn't late, they just didn't place my order but charged me for the food.  On hold, basically this service SUCKS and I will not use it again, suggest you don't either if you want to eat.  How are they staying in business?",0
We usually order via Foodler and have had no issues. Unfortunately Foodler has been acquired by Grubhub and now all orders are through GrubHub. We ordered this evening and got an email an hour later saying our order was cancelled. Reason was not clear. Overall a waste of time.,0
I had  trouble placing an online order and called Grubhub customer service to assist.  After two phone calls to different reps were unable to assist providing no help and seemingly  being unfamiliar with the current promotions. Big waste of time and energy. Stick with postmates,0
horrible horrible horrible- do not use- will not take accountability for anything- will be on hold for like 4 hours and not talk to anyone- the ceo of this company needs to rethink the business model- so unhappy- used services for four to five years- will never again!!!!!!!!!!!!!,0
"Places an order a day ahead of time and scheduled to me delivered between meetings (11:30a.m.).  Did not show up until 12:30pm.  Food was cold.  I called the restaurant to make sure it wasn't there fault, but they had the food ready and waiting.  WILL NEVER USE THIS SERVICE AGAIN!",0
"First and last time I use GrubHub, I ordered and heard nothing after ""your order is cooking"". It simply never arrived. When I called the restaurant, they pretended to have no idea what I was talking about. Really would have appreciated some dinner as I was at work until 11:00pm :(",0
"GrubHub has ruined all my favorite delivery services!!!! Searching on their website it lame, why is it the the food on grubhub is more expensive than when the restaurant offers delivery on other sites?, and now my orders never seem to make it to the restaurant...please stop GrubHub!",0
"This is a huge scam, we ordered food and like many reviews here they never got delivered to us and their customer representative refuses to refund the money and give you a stupid $20 dollar credit which is useless cause you have to use it in 30 days. Stay away from this scam business!",0
Grubhub absolutely sucks when it comes to delivery!! Either the food is extremely late getting to you or they won't show at all. You call customer service and all they offer you is a sorry! You have to ask for a refund. You'll be better off going to pick up the food you want yourself.,0
GH cancelled my simple Rubio's order yesterday.  They said they were too busy!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! WTF ?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!? TOO BUSY??????????  When I heard that I called them to complain.   They said most likely it was Rubios that canceled b/c THEY were too busy.  THAT'S bull$#*!!!!!!!!!!!!,0
"They offer an ""automatic discount"" that they do not apply then charge a fortune for food that should ordinarily be inexpensive. And, it takes forever. I am not typically one to complain, but this was a joke and I ended up paying $22 for a $6 sandwich and chips. I will never use them again.",0
"They took my money but never placed my order. I found out when I called the restaurant. Then customer service was a long wait to get the order cancelled, which is weird because it was never placed, but still needed to get my money back. Card was charged, I hope the refund posts just as quickly.",0
We placed order couple of times but food never arrived even after they confirmed that it will arrive in 40-50 minutes. After 1 hours on calling customer care - they said that no driver is available !! What a joke !! Is this how anyone can run the business !!   Stay away guys from this service !!,0
i orders bbq through grubhub the woman took half our order took our brisket from the container pretty much too half of our food and we called $#*!eys to see where our food was the manager had personally packaged our food and he said everything was in the bag and it shouldve arrived but it didnt .,0
My first ordering experience was extremely disappointing beyond words. Food wasn't delivered until 2 hrs and and it was cold and not edible. customer service put me hold more than 15 mins and it is was incredibly ridiculous. Never ordering again! THE WORST EVER CUSTOMER SERVICE I HAVE EXPERIENCE!!!!,0
Some law firm should bring a class action suit against GH. They cancel your order but you do not get a credit card refund for a number of days. While you wait GH uses your money and you are paying interest if you have a credit card balance. GH should be liable for the money and also pay punitive bdamages,0
Grubhub stole my credit card information when I placed an order with them in Fort Lauderdale. They denied it although the card was only used for that one transaction in six months. The restaurant never had the info nor the driver. It was the administrator of the site. They still denied it. NEVER AGAIN!!!,0
"Waited for our food for two hours then received a notice our order was cancelled with no explanation. Save your money and time, go elsewhere. Previous two times orders were missing items and we were giving it one more chance. Obviously a mistake, these people need to learn how to provide quality control.",0
"Grubhub should go out of business with UberEATS hitting the scene. I have had 3 orders now in which they use a crappy restaurant that is 3 hours late with my order.  My order tonight was just not confirmed with the restaurant, and no notification. Customer service didn't even offer anything!!  They suck!",0
"I've ordered through GrubHub a few times with mixed results. Unfortunately, it seems that the service is in serious decline in recent months. Out of the last 4 orders I've placed 3 have been significantly late (over 40 minutes). Contacting customer service has useless and they seem to willfully unhelpful.",0
"I should have read the reviews first. To make a long story short, ordered food at 7:26pm. it is 9:07pm and food isn't here yet. I even got a call from the restaurant I ordered from to say the food has been sitting for an hour, and I shouldn't use Grubhub, they do this all the time. Stay away from Grubhub.",0
"Grubhub messes up my order to my detriment and their gain every day. I pay for items I don't get every day. ""Customer care"" is intentionally annoying to deal with to deter customers from even bothering to attempt to get their $ back because dealing with their team of idiots is another wasted hour of life.",0
I ordered from California Pizza It was delicious but cold. I called because my order was an hour and a half late and the lady apologized and said she would send us a 10 dollar coupon that never came. If you like cold food and feeling hangry I guess GrubHub is the place for you. Awful first time experience.,0
Late deliveries. Deliveries never made. Deliveries seldom wrong when they were made. Customer service is nothing but a call center with people who are hard to understand who cannot help you. Left on hold multiple times for over 20 minutes while trying to make a complaint with the customer service (call center),0
"I used grub hub to place a delivery order for the first time, from a place I usually order from... but my order was delivered a half hour AFTER their allotted time frame. I wouldnt use this service again, and Since I prepaid I included a 20% that should have been way less. ALWAYS CALL & Always tip upon delivery",0
"I ordered for our office a little after 11:30 am.  In five minutes, the delivery time had changed to 3:02 pm.  $50 for two people for sandwiches from a place 10 minutes away.  Called to cancel and what a surprise-couldn't.  When the food came, it was very marginal and cold.  SO never again, GrubHub.  Don't do it.",0
DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY WITH GRUBHUB. GOOD CHANCE YOU WONT RECIEVE YOUR ORDER IT WILL BE HOURS LATE AND DISGUSTING AND GRUBHUB WILL DO NOTHING BUT OFFER A FEW DOLLARS CREDIT. WILL SPREAD THE MESSAGE TO AS MANY PEOPLE AS POSSIBLE. GO TO DOORDASH!! MUCH BETTER CUSTOMER SERVICE AND MORE VARIETY OF RESTAURANTS,0
"Order already late, now a lame story that I canceled the order.  Back 2 Uber Eats!  That's what I get for chasing ""Waterfalls"" & trying something new.  I will pay the $7 delivery fee to deal with competent individuals. The only thing ppl do right & swift is deduct the funds from your acct.  All downhill after that",0
Driver never showed up and I was charge twice.,1
"not too friendly. not a good source of money. no respect. a definite ""no"".",1
No action is being taken on tricky deceitful drivers sucking the passengers,1
"Unfortunately though, I recently had a bad experience with a driver service was worse...",1
Look out for an older gentleman in the Palm Desert area named Robert in a white nissan versa,1
very poor services. the person doesnot know the exact address. controlled by false messages. false rate.,1
Poor driving and texting / address look up while driving and getting into accidents with no care for others,1
UBER consistently let you down at Laguardia The drivers cancel your ride for no reason then you get charged,1
I requested 4 different ubers and every uber canceled on me. Uber is a joke. If you were smart you would use lift.,1
Drivers are allowed to cancel for no reason and the customer is charged a cancellation fee. Is this Ubers new scam?,1
Warning uber is a scam and there is no customer service and there drivers are drunks and drug addicts and sexual harassment,1
This guy is the worst Uber driver I have ever met he doesn't even show up when asked to be picked up do not let him drive you anywhere,1
I got quoted for $45 and ended up paying $64. The driver purposely drove through a $#*! ton of tolls! Stay away from Uber..esp. from DFW.,1
Just wasted 90 minutes after a 49ers game waiting for Uber drivers which never showed. For major events these folks are absolutely incompetent.,1
"Anti gay bully, told me, faggot fck ur self with mcd frappe u loser faggots should die. If uber ever sends him to better find a request another driver",1
Requestrd a Uber lift in Santa Monica via their app and waitrd outside Hotel. No driver to be seen. Driver cancelled and chargeme 5 dollars via PayPal. A scam!,1
"I have a worst experience in UBER. Most Cheated company, worst drivers, rash driving. Never ever think to book this cab. I am not getting the option of negative rating.",1
The driver never showed up even though he messaged me he would be here in 25 min. I had to search the site and hours later it said driver cancelled. They are a joke of a business.,1
Can uber driver park in front of britomart station or not .... driver name was Sid and Car number 63 Can I get immediately update on his $#*! response .... otherwise I will find other way,1
We tried getting an Uber THREE time and they canceled on us each time and waited until the last minute to cancel on us. This is terrible customer service. It's honestly unbelievable. DONT USE UBER.,1
"AHV J21 This vehicle with an Uber sign in front window blasts through neighborhoods passing people on the right hand side when it's one lane each direction, in the heart of valrico near school zones",1
"This is the 3rd time uber drivers have cancelled my journey and then when I reorder price has mysteriously gone up 3x. It is a joke and it ends up cheaper using a normal minicab, £28 instead of £60.",1
Uber is one of the worst cab provider... every time I face some problem... last time was driver did not come even after several phone calls and finally I had to pay phenality for that... I simply deleted the app,1
We caught our Uber driver stealing our phone in Las Vegas. Uber did nothing to resolve the situation. And then they sent us an email stating they investigated and the case was closed. Please take Lyft or a taxi.,1
drivers have hidden cameras that they use for their own personal gains and you might end up on worldstar or YouTube for making some silly comment that you made while you were drunk. Sucky company for drivers too.,1
Need to watch where the driver going. This is the 2nd time for me where the driver trying to bring you around even though his map showing the faster way to get to your destination. Even though there is no traffic and closed road.,1
I had booked a uber cab and than i had received a call from driver. After comfomation i wait one houor for cab but there is not even a sigal response.When i call back Nobody was picking my call. I will never take uber cab in my life.,1
Constant problems in Manhattan. I get msg - that 'driver arriving now' and then nothing. And they then have the audacity to charge a cancellation fee. I am deleting this app from my phone. There has got to be a better service than Uber,1
"I used Uber 6 times and twice They cancelled my order and charged me a $5 cancellation fee both times but it was Uber who cancelled, not me. There is no customer service so they just pocket the money. $10 is all they will ever steal from me.",1
"The drivers constantly cancel and charge late fees. Customer service is only reachable through the app (no phone #), and they're useless. The little money potentially saved isn't worth the hassle, from what used to be an OK company and idea. SMH.",1
You have to be kidding! I was here waiting and the driver's car drove right past us! I am not paying for this cancellation. I literally chased this guy down there street and he said too bad and cancelled my ride. Then uber charged me $5??? Show quoted text,1
"Why do you continue to overcharge rides and call it a cancellation fee. I never moved from my original site. Uber driver stopped several blocks away, then turned around and left and stuck me with a $5 cancellation fee. He cancelled me, not me cancelling him.",1
Horrific experience I waited for an Uber driver for 30 minutes stupid me !!!! He kept saying he be there in 2 to 3 minute he never showed up !!!!Uber had a nerve to charge me for the ride I tried to get in contact with customer service they were nothing but rude,1
An uber was called to bring my friends home. He heard them argue the entire way home it's a friend that she was trying leave. He then proceeded to pick the same girl up and take her to the airport. As several of us told him not to take her because she was drunk.,1
Can't for the life of me why this man was driving so wreckless. License plate wml 7582 va. Must have been drunk. With uber stickers in the window like he worked for them. Drunk. I don't think uber would like being represented by this sicko.. teenagers drive better.,1
"Driver got lost , could not find us. He was dressed like a junkie, Made U turns, drove us unsafely in an old, dirty car. In the end we were overcharged. Next time we were in Chicago, we just booked through a local limo company with great service and reasonable prices",1
I was run off the road yesterday by a car with the Uber sign in the window. Make sure this guy isn't your ride Licenses number 7JXD538. It happened at Powell st. and 580 at 10:37 in the morning. He then even gave me the finger! The guy in the back seat looked quite nervous.,1
Uber driver has let the meter on even after the ride was completed. I lost my money because of this. He rode a good 2hrs on the road. Wrote to the customer support multiple times but no one seems to care as soon as I explained my situation. They didn't even bother to reply.,1
"Uber was absolutely horrible, I stepped outside of the vehicle for a moment and the car took off with my backpack. My backpack contained my keys, wallet, and everything else i had. This is the worst taxi service that i have ever received, I would not advise using this service.",1
The drivers are rude and refuse to come at the pickup location _ Drivers Name : Kamaljeet PB 01A5756. They have an excuse of getting charged for the parking lot. as well when asked to come at pick location straight away says no. Another person in the que is Baldev with Car number,1
"My girlfriend use this frequently but every single time that I used this service I had bad experiences. Usually the drivers don't know the city at all and they always take the longest route, in order to charge the maximum fare. Also, I have bad experience dealing with rude drivers.",1
"There is an uber driver here in St. Pete that is a drug user and dealer; he offered me marijuana and or pills. He was high, his eyes were glassy and glazed-over he and his car had the stench of marijuana. He also offered rides off the app and is a go between for an escort. Mark gukpm",1
"The driver drove me a distance of what would have been a $10 cab ride and charged $35.00 and that's not the worst part. He tried to charge my credit card $1850.00 and $1200.00. Luckily Discover card caught it, flagged it and denied it. The charge was attempted through a company called Lavish Limos.",1
I booked uber but those drivers told that we are very far we won't come to pick you.up...they suggested me to cancel it and book it again...again the next driver told me the same... I will be simply charged due to cancellation... The company should check this... worst experience as I was in hurry...,1
"I used Uber for the first time this weekend in New Orleans from the Amtrac to the French Quarter....cost $68.85. Took the taxi on the way back and it was $17.00. Taxi driver was great ....Uber driver was snarky. Wish I had read the reviews before I signed up for Uber, but, I will never use it again.",1
Drivers alway are complaining about how the job sucks... i really don't care to hear about your problem. They tell you thier sad story so you will tip them i guess... i don't need a guilt trip with my ride. Get a different job if ypu don't like the one you have... and clean your car once in a while.,1
"i got a cab coming and saying he is an uber, later when we arrived he said that he is actually an uber taxi and i have to pay as it goes not to be cherged from account as normal uber. i said that i dont have money and i specifially asked him if he is an uber so i can use my paypal account and he said yes",1
"$20 dollars to get to my destination, $75 dollars for the same ride home!!!! Thanks for the price gouge Uber!!!! Almost crashed on the way there, creepy driver on the way from!!! Cab drivers telling you they're Uber trying to get you in there vehicles. Will never use this service again!!! First and last!!!!",1
App was showing me cab is 5 minutes away. By the time I come down from my building and reach my society gate. The cab was there but drive didn't allow me to seat. He said I have cancelled ur ride. He didn't even call me before canceling it. It was quite rude. Never expected such kind of experience with uber.,1
Hired uber to drive to Boston Garden for concert tonight. Driver shows up on time first time driver. Did not have a clue on how to get to Boston Garden. Could get another Uber but not on time. Ended up driving in ourselves . Will use a cab from now on. Can't rely on company that doesn't know what they are doing.,1
Charged me 13$ To get dropped off at airport Could not speak English dropped me off in a parking lot across from airport !! Took uber home from airport got charged 50.73. It's impossible to contact someon there. And it was my second mom English speaking cabbie. Who's car stunk like yellow cabs. Cabbies. Frustrated.,1
because they charged from my credit cart 3 times and i never can take money back. Uber taxi driver forced me to pay in the car. He said Uber will not charge but they charged two more times. I sent them my statement I am talking with them it is not working out. Do not use Uber because serial killer could drive you too,1
Tonight at 1 am while coming back from phoenix market city i put my phone on charging and forgot to take it...i called the cab driver after 15 mins asking for the phone and he started giving random excuses....i called the police as well and plan to file an fir tomorrow morning...his name is manjunath and his number is 8494844422,1
"requested for uber at 09:30am to reach office, it showed waiting of 8 minutes. Waited for ueber till 10:00am and then saw d tracker,the driver was nowhere near to my place. Called him and explained the directions ,,no response till 10:10am.. finally booked ola cab and reached my office. Will never book uber again..this was d second time..",1
"I had to catch a flight from delhi so I called uber to my location but I don't know where the driver reached and he didn't even called me to ask my location instead I had to call him back when he tooked so long ,since I was getting late for my flight so I need to cancel the booking. And now I need to pay the cancellation charge when it wasn't even my fault.",1
Filed with the police. (This company needs to check and make sure there employees are legit) I was using Uber for the first time and I thought I was in an Uber vehicle. (They had an uber sign in the window) The driver told me I could only use cash and he gave me a receipt from northside executive LLC $225 to go from The airport to a hotel 11 miles away. Be careful,1
"I traveled with the Uber Swift car (MH-14 FC 1375) at Hinjewadi,Pune Maharatstra. I am travelling at night time the driver is not driving car properly and always looking at the mirror. I change my place the he again adjust the mirror toward me. I have left the car in between. The driver was drank.... and talking in rude language. The Uber is not keeping good drivers.",1
I ordered an Uber and the driver picked up the wrong riders. I contacted Uber and received a notification that I would receive a refund and they never gave me my refund and no one has gotten back to me no matter how many times I have contacted them. They acknowledged that someone else took my ride but still didn't refund the money. Horrible customer service. Or lack there of.,1
"I was having my 18 yr old son picked up and the driver was texting and driving and I told him not to, cancelled my ride and now my account is disabled. It gets better, Im trying to resolve my issue and they are trying to tell me that the email on file doesnt match the one in their records. I only use the one email so Im not getting any help. So I have moved to Lyft!! Screw Uber!",1
Uber drivers need to retake their driving test because they can't can't drive. You guys get confused with directions too much. Uberpool rips off customers to make the most bang for there buck. I was literally late for work cuz we had to pick up some bozo in the opposite direction. And UberEats some B!@#$ ate my apple pie I ordered. Im not gonna go into details about that tho! Boycott Uber,1
Without a doubt the worst experience of my life with Internet based services. Drivers in NYC either can't follow directions or have difficulty conversing in English. I couldn't find a way to communicate my frustrations with Uber. The phone number posted goes to a fax machine or another digital line. I am a SF Bay Area resident and was shocked at my experience. Moving on to give Lyft a try.,1
I have been recently using uber cab in Prahalad nagar Ahmadabad. i have received bill amount through massage from uber cab service. The actual billing amount is Rs.49. but drivers did not agree to this amount is ok. he is taken Rs.104 from me. also driver was very rude and tourchable . i don't book uber taxi service in my entire life. So look into this and short out this issue on urgent basis.,1
"Terrible experience with Uber service today. The rider Roger, Chrysler 300, 7LHV109 accepted my ride request but never showed up and ignored my calls and text messages. My App showed he was sitting near a shopping plaza a mile away instead of picking me up. After 35 minutes in the heat, my cell phone died and I had to take a taxi. Terrible service! And Uber charged me money for its driver's failure!",1
"NEVER RIDE WITH UBER, on new years day me and Jess rode home with Uber, it is not the pricing that upset us, its the fact that the beyond rude driver hit my brothers car on the way down from my drive way. After contacting Uber with images of the damage and feedback of the experience they refuse to help us in any way. Never have i been in contact with such rude people, looks like I'm back with taxis.",1
"Too many times now an Uber driver has come to pick me up, discovered where I want to go, refused to take me, kicks me out of car and I still get billed five bucks from Uber. It's a fricking joke. Of course after a long series of emails Uber eventually gives me the five bucks back but continue to allow their drivers to rip people off. After all, UUber gets their cut so why take these drivers off the road.",1
"Visiting Canada but drivers can't speak English so theres an immediate communication barrier which is not good in a foreign country. The driver never looked for me; 2 minutes are up. I tried to cancel, then found him. He didn't take me but was billed anyway. 2 minutes is never enough time to identify a drivver. No signage on their cars.....terrible service. Beware. Bad business model. Take a taxi instead.",1
This Uber driver in the Arcadia CA area in a black Lexus license plates 7HLN158 instead of making a right turn on a right turn only lane almost hit my car and started honking at me flick me off so I took a pic of his plate then he followed me into a shopping center to verbally attack me and he did all this with passengers in his car be careful if you get him as a driver his an aggressive and dangers driver.,1
"All I can say is if you enjoy being yelled at, sword at, insulted, threatened, having advances made at you, spending 20 min to make 5 min trip because the driver has zero navigational skills, have to rebook your trip several times because drivers keep cancelling, being over charged and double charged then Uber is the ride company for you. I would rather freeze walking to work in -30C weather than get into another Uber.",1
Omg uber is the worse service ever. Expensive and now you have to pool with stranger .. The driver are rude !!! Evey week I have to go to doctor appointment to the same address and I have isssue with the driver finding the correct address because his gps show a different point of pick up .the worse part the driver cancel and I get charge for it BS ..soon uber will lose all his customer because the service is just awful.,1
I schefuled a pickup on Miami Beach waited much longer than was quoted on the map. The map kept changing time to a longer period. After a while I called the driver to see where he was and he said in Spanish that he didn't speak English. I canceled the trip and tried to schedule another and the price went from $16 to $43. I called Central taxi and had a car in 3 minutes for less money. I seriously doubt I'll use Uber again.,1
"I would never use UBER again. Driver was unprofessional he took wrong direction tried to drive me to other state. UBER charged me for that services I never used, I tried to contact them but no one returned my money back for that services I never used but they charged until i contacted to my credit card. I really disappointed and i would never use UBER again. I would suggest people to think twice if they need such a service.",1
My first ride with Uber went like this. The driver asked me what time my flight was. Naturally I wanted to get there early to check in beat the traffic and to make sure I would get through security on time. My Uber driver took that opportunity to drive around the suburbs to hike up the fare. so he could run into traffic. A 45 minute trip took 1.5 hours. I only made my flight because I sprinted through the airport. Uber sucks,1
"I'm a frequent uber user and I had no problems until this uber pool decided to introduce the short walk crap. I'm always having issues with the drivers, as I see an address and the driver sees another address. And a cancellation fee? Are you serious? There are many incompetent drivers out there so why do I have to pay $5 fee when they cancel? I'm saying bye to this service and I will make sure all my friends are aware of your games.",1
"I was late for my work and appointment because driver's cancelled it for no reason, my place is easy to find so I wondered why they kept cancelling my trip. I had cancelled many times...it's not funny anymore "" Uber"" . I am almost done with you ""uber"". This company Sucks! I've been nice to all your drivers even if sometimes some of the uber driver's stinks I was still polite towards him. Now I download Lyft and will try it. Thank-you Uber!!!",1
"Never seen before, the driver don't come for pick up and charged me 5 pound cancellation fee , I called for an other driver , the estate charge was 17 pound maximum, the driver confirm that it will be around 14 pound , they charged me 21 pound . I been charged for the same distance 16 pound to 17 pound with golden line . I tried to call them their's no number for those people. This company is really rubbish . I will never use it again. AVOID IT .",1
"Forgot car/house keys in the car. Attempted to contact driver twice a few hours after the incident, he hung up on me both times after I explained why I was calling. Sent an email to uber with no response. Called Uber- voice message saying best way to contact is through email (obviously not). Went to uber headquarters-absolutely no help. The guy in charge of lost and found there said that he was not allowed to contact the driver. What can you do?!?",1
I always had a good drive with the uber. But today morning I have my exam from 9. I call the uber driver before 35 mint so that I can reach early.. And he revived my call and told me he will reach within 5mint I waited for him for 20 mint and the driver didnot turned up and I literally missed my exam.. please select some professional driver or else it will be a great loss for the Uber company.. (+917636878824) this driver should need to learn a lesson.,1
"In Dallas for a visit with our son, who is a student at SMU. Great Uber ride to dinner, but return from dinner a nightmare. Had two Uber trips cancel and bill me for no show, while we were waiting and with no contact from driver. Will clearly contest no show charge - finally got home with an Uber direct ""off the record"" as she felt sorry for the problems we'd had. Am no longer the raving fan I was - and if it happens again will give uber up for Lyft or taxis",1
"We arrived at San Fransisco Airport and walked towards the taxi rank.We were approached by a taxi driver offering to take us to our hotel he did say he was a Uber driver ( I do not have an Uber account). I knew that the fare should be around $45. During the journey our driver was constantly on his mobile phone either texting or speaking to other drivers. Arriving at our hotel he charged us $95. I my opinion don't use them, i certainly will never use them again.",1
"worst service i had booked cab from kondapur to Chilkur Balaji temple,they accepted booking but when driver came and asked were to go when i said to Chilkur Balaji temple then the driver is not ready to come with us.he reply's they don't provide service out the city and i have to cancelled my cab and they charged me for cancellation charges also this is very disgusting thing i ever faced from uber when they don't provide service to the area.then how can they accept the booking",1
"I have had some terrible experiences with the uber cab drivers. They are terrible with directions and they are extremely arrogant. Once a driver asked me to get off the cab because he thought I gave the wrong pick up address. And in another instance, the driver shouted at me because I told him to take a specific route. I have had many such experiences and so have my family members.. If anyone faces an issue like this, please take them directly to the police station. I regret not doing that myself..",1
So I rode about a week or two ago and I had a few hour drive . Was already costing me enough and I was disrespected due to being trans and the driver stopped on the way never stopping the meter so I was charged extra . Wrote uber and they said they can't do nothing but say sorry and have an good day . Wrote in over and over and there just like again we can't give you credit or anything have an good day Useless and an waste of time Never suggesting them to anyone Worst company in the world Wouldn't recommend them to anyone,1
"I recently used Uber got to see the pic of the driver who was coming to get me and my friends, when the driver pulled up she had someone in the passanger seat with her there was 4 of us guys for this Uber ride, she told me she didn't know there was going to be 4 of us and said the passanger was her husband and told him he would have to go to the bar while she dropped us of since there was 4 of us and needed his space too and would be back for him, this made me feel really awkward and now ill take a taxi before calling Uber",1
"My granddaughter and I ordered an uber from santa monica beach pier . Three drivers cancelled and I was charged for the third one with them stating that the driver waited over 2 minutes for me. I was at the pickup point long before I ever contacted this driver. He evidently left and charged me with a cancellation fee and I followed the rules. Uber has shown to a very shadowy company from the get go. From now on, I will be a customer of Lyft! I have disputed this with the BBB, no response from uber so now I am making you aware.",1
"In suburban Tampa, we requested a car to Tampa International Airport. The driver, Lillie, was totally rude and incompetent. The vehicle had her own personal luggage in the back, so there was no room for ours. Her comment, in barely understandable English, was that we should have said the ride was to the airport. Duh. Apparently she did not know that Tampa International Airport is an actual airport. She slammed the door and yelled that we would have to call another Uber. If you need an Uber in Tampa, be sure you don't get Lillie.",1
"Uber is frud , uber driver charged double amount from me on 20/10/2017. I was traveling from Thane to vikroli. I checked amount was Rs 176. After dropping me he charged Rs. 470. About this problem I discussed through sms but no positive response from customer care. They are not even return my money. Driver create show on the road so I paid money. But customer care people are also frud people. They don't want to resolve the Issue My suggestion is don't go With uber. They don't even have contact number. They are cheaper and cheater",1
"After ordering out uber, we had waited quite awhile and could see on the App she continued to sit at the gas station down the road for 15 minutes. I called to ask her if she was still coming and she yelled at me ""I'm $#*!ing driving down the road to get your $#*!ing ass you $#*!"" after that I told her to cancel the drive because I did not want to ride with someone who was so rude and disrespectful. She needed up charging me anyways. I am not one to write reviews but this was the worst service/ person I have ever had to deal with.",1
"I have had several instances recently where I go to order and Uber tells me it's 2-3 minutes and then I confirm the order and it's 8-10 minutes (tech glitches). I have also had drivers who can't speak English and I must tell them where to go despite them having their map app on their phone available to them. Incompetent drivers and failing technology are not ingredients for a good user experience. When notified of their failings, Uber curtly replies that they work hard to provide the best user experience. Really, that's your best?",1
I was at the airport and figured I would try Uber ..first guy ..we went around in circles Trying to navigate the map.. I don't Know where I am at the airport they say you can contact the driver or text I couldn't Second driver same thing ..you would think one of them would call me they could see I was still standing lost ..never ever again at least real cab drivers call you and let you know where to go and where they can meet you.. I hope they do not charge Me doe those two cancelations that would be the icing on the cake.. Uber you suck Bigtime,1
"I ordered an Uber to get to an interview in Tempe and I live in Gilbert. I had the same Uber drive to and from the interview... David. On the ride there he charged me the normal amount. Then on the way back he charged me an extra 50$ for an ""accident"" in the car. There was no accident I was at an interview! I would love to know what I did. They make up accidents so that they can make more money. It is ridiculous. This is one of the worst company's to use. DO NOT USE THEM. Use lyft they are way more trustworthy and will not cheat you and take your money!",1
"I have a issue with one of my ride which I was wrongly charged. But Uber is not giving me such option where I can write about this or even ask about it. On 17th of jan., 2017 i booked a uber from besent nagar, Chennai to Hotel leela Palace, mrc nagar. First rate estate was showing approx INR 60 but receipt came of INR 130. Then i checked and found that driver started the meter from where he got that i request a cab and drop location was also wrong, he stopped the meter somewhere else after droped me at my location. My email id is tanwarvikas00@gmail.com",1
"I like the convenience of Uber, and have been a loyal customer for a long time. HOWEVER, when TWO of their drivers cancel on me within minutes, and then the PRICE GOES UP for the next one... I'm not a happy camper. I used to refer all of my friends to this service, especially the ones using Lyft.... Not any longer. $#*! this service, their drivers that were disrespectful on the phone with me... My business and my friends' business will go elsewhere. Thanks Uber, for your killings, lack of customer service, entitlement and garbage program. Byyyyyeeeeeeeeeeee.",1
"My wife had a foot operation and we used Uber in Miami against my wish, but the drivers had no training ie waiting for the passenger to get downstairs from their flat. We were over charged and Uber promised but we never got the refunds. The best option is to get a licensed cab where ever you may live, if you go to London ever, Uber cars are more expensive than black cabs in the rush hours and they don't know, even with GARMIN where they are going. PS ; Uber is valued in Billions on the stock market, because they get 15% of the cost of the ride worldwide everyday.",1
"So I used UBER last night... NEVER USE IT! I got dropped off by the first guy, before I could even put my seatbelt on (all of a sudden had to take his wife to work) So I call another Uber (gives me a 2.5 times rate.... with no information on what the heck the rate is, NO OTHER OPTION - that or no UBER, and every time you search another one.. the rate gets higher and higher....) I get home, there's no service.. I tip the guy decently in cash for getting me home finally Get inside, my wifi loads up UBER receipt $79!!!!!!! for a 15 minute ride........... NEVER AGAIN",1
"Worst customer service I have ever dealt with. I was charged an extra $100 for a ""cleaning fee"" 3 days after my trip with no notice. ONE HUNDRED DOLLARS. Are you serious uber?? Then the ""customer service rep"" sent me the picture our driver sent to them claiming his car was dirty and needed to pay to clean, was just his car mat with some dirt on. So I had to pay $100 extra dollars on top of the over priced fare for dirt he could have wiped off. When you drive groups of people all day and all night, your car will not be perfect. $#*! UBER I will never use them again.",1
"I wont ever use uber again, they are very unprofessional and high who ever the hell they want. just recently my friend used an uber to go to her boyfriends when she go in the uber her uber driver asked her if she wanted some water, she said yes. he grabbed some water from the front seat opening it for her. the next thing she knew he turned off the meter and told her it would be free of charge...... the end of the night she was in the hospital getting a rape test done that came back positive.... this uber driver date rape drugged her water and raped her. DONT USE UBER",1
"I have enjoyed Uber until 03/14/2016. Now I'm done. I'm at a Marriott in DC. Driver calls and asks where I am. I'm in front. He says no you're not. He realizes he is not at the front entrance and tells me to walk around back. I said no. He said then cancel the trip. I cancelled, rebooked, the same driver took the route! I cancelled again and took a taxi. Uber charged me $5 each for the cancellations. YOU CAN NOT CONTACT ANYONE WITH UBER. It was easy to get a credit, but not a refund. YOU STEAL MY MONEY AND GIVE ME A CREDIT! Never again Uber. I will never use Uber again.",1
Yesterday was the first and last time I use Uber. Our first driver kept asking us where to go even though he had his gps telling him where to go. Our second driver last night could not find us and kept telling me that I gave him a wrong address when in fact he too could not use gps as well. After 20 min of directing him to us we finally began the trip home. Again we had to direct him all the way because he could not read his gps. WOW! Then came the charge....more than double what we paid for the first ride. Nothing I hate more than having to pay someone to do their job. Good riddens to Uber!,1
"This happened in Washington DC, need to get to the airport. Uber driver arrives, sees me and my family, kids, then leaves inmediately, without even saying why. Uber then charges me a $5 cancelation, charges me!!!. I don't know what to do, really need to get to the airpost, so I request them again. Another driver arrives, and does exactly the same thing. Uber does exactly the same thing of course and charges me another $5. What is this?. On top of all that, no way to contact them, worst service I've seen in my entire life. Of course I am fighting them and I will get my money back one way or another. Stay away.",1
"Always have good experience with Uber but I think their quality is declining. I booked an Uber today. 1990 toyota camry, AC was not ON and didnt work. the seat had some kind of plastic cover which made the experience ever worst. wanted to keep bag in the trunk but the trunk was junk. The driver was irritating kept asking how long have you been in Chicago. He had phone in one hand and was driving with the other and kept missing the direction even though it was clear on his cell phone on he route we were taking. I will think twice before requesting an Uber because a Cab provides me with better experience then Uber",1
called for uber to take us to union station from American university section of DC. initial proposed charge was for $21 then just before pick up got message surge pricing in effect. without proposed charge. agreed since too late to reschedule with other company. pick up was at 9:47 am and there was little traffic. Charge was $55.82. Fee for larger vehicle to accommodate handicap from Regan airport on return was $34 without tip. A longer trip. Contacted uber which was difficult and no remorse whatsoever. Will never use uber again as no trtust factor at all. Car was mediocre at best. not a accompany to be trusted under any circumstances.,1
"Last nite i got a ride to the hospital.I have a bad leg,i can see hospital from my house.So i thought i would try uber this was my thrid ride i get a cab all the time he picker me up at my house.I guess he was in a bad mood that happens i understand that when we got there he charged me 7.00 my cab costs me 4.00 dollars i was robbed and when i went i was pissed i have been there 20 years and i told myy people you just lost a ton of buss every one was going to try it but not now and how do you know if my ride was 1 that got recorder for my free rides in the future. Not that i will ever use it again.You lost a lot of buss thanks captain tom 443 762 7273",1
"I've had countless issues with uber drivers claiming false cancellations, claiming to have picked me up when they hadn't, etc. Tonight a guy picked me up and immediately started hinting that I lived too far away. Mid way through the ride he finally concluded that I did,in fact, live too far away (he just wasn't familiar with the New York area at ALL- NO, Brooklyn isn't in Manhattan). He kicked me out of the car in the middle of the night in a bad neighborhood and cancelled the ride. I had to walk with my three heavy bags all the way home because of other issues with false cancellations and uber. Lyft isn't much better but fewer terrible experiences for sure.",1
"You can't pay cash on Uber, so you can't control how much they put on your card. A driverthat Uber seems to support is to not show your trip as ended. So. The driver picked up my girlfriend and dropped her at my house, both addresses were input in the App, but she got no receipt that day as the trip according to Uber wasn't ended until over 20 hours and 50 miles. I assume the driver defrauded us, or there was a glitch in their software, but after days of correspondence and sending a copy of the receipt, I still get the run-around. I fought for Uber to be allowed here in Miami as the cabs were horrible. Now the cabs are better, and I can avoid being scammed using Uber!",1
It has happened to me 3 times in a row that I had scheduled a ride and the drivers never showed up. One driver never showed up called me stating that he missed an exit both times I missed my flight to the airport. You guys have bunch of fags working for you guys can't tech on time Uber is not reliable at all because they are making so much money they don't care about their customers I submitted a complain last time no one responded me don't have any number that you can call they are just app based and have a horrible service! Driver name was NABIN driving TOYOTA VENZA plate# T694057C don't trust this driver charged me money and never gave it back. Very upset about this situation,1
Your drivers are Horrendous! one of your imature drivers was coming Down Delph lane near the TJs pub and he was not looking wear he was going I was coming on opposite street near the woodhouse garage and your driver bumped into my van and he drove of so I saw him at the traffic lights and he said he was in a hurry to the train station but he was going the totally opposite way it is hirrendous I hope you loos business and I know your company used to be around before you used to deal drugs and perv on school kids am I right to say you had a driver in the back with a school kid so you will not get my business at all p.s no one should go through what I have been through from no one.,1
"Uber drivers are not held to the same standards as cab drivers. They often cancel your ride and the company will put the charge onto your credit card. I have been trying to get 2 of those charges off of my card now for months with no resolution, having sent at least 8 emails to numerous individuals. It seems like you can never connect with the same person to solve your problem and there is absolutely no way to make contact by phone. I also tried to get an Uber out of the country and the guy just never showed. Another driver had no idea how to get to the airport that was 15 minutes away and took a route that took over an hour and I was almost late for my flight. Be wary travelers!",1
"I booked a taxi through UBER, he arrived within about 10 minutes. He drove past me and the on the app I seen him driving in circles. I tried calling him. Then he called me and said he could no longer do my journey and that I must press cancel on the app and order another one. Bare in mind this is on New Years Eve, a 23 year old girl alone, with no coat, visiting her sick mother in hospital. I cancelled it on the app as he advised as I could not be bothered arguing, and it charged me £4 for cancellation even though I did not want to cancel it, he said I had to! As they are ignoring my emails, my bank are recovering the funds. I would rather give the £4 to charity rather than these con-men!",1
"The pickup time on the Uber app fluctuated between 3 minutes to 10 then 18 minutes and back to 5 for over an hour. The Uber car never showed, neither did the cabs I called to pick me up from a retirement community in West Palm Beach two days after my father died. I missed my flight and now I'm worried Uber will charge my card or use it illegally since the app requires you to input your payment information into their system before the car pickup is authorized. At least the cabs I called don't have me locked into a financial trap. Definitely not a fan of a business taking my personal information without providing me a service. I selected a 1 for rating only because this site requires a rating but Uber gets a Zero from me.",1
I requested a ride at 7:45pm I could see the driver on the map never leave his home. The driver calls me and tells me he is outside my home when I knew he wasn't I called back and the driver was very rude he was very rude I hate to say it but mostly all every African drivers I get from uber are rude and they always have an attitude. The driver told me he was not coming to pick me and hung on me I was then charged a cancellation fee when the driver was the one that cancelled the trip. I never have this issue with lyft uber needs to get better drivers I will not be taking another uber i will use lyft or walk to my destination. I find it ridiculous I have to deal with someone rude when they are getting paid to drive me around.,1
"If you are in the Philadelphia area and your uber driver is Daemon, cancel it real quick. When she picked me up she was at the wrong address so I had to literally walk a 1/2 block to her car and when she called me to ask where I was at, she was rude, even though she was at the wrong house! Her car smelled very bad (musty and dirty clothes) and it was dirty! She had water bottles on the floor and crumbs on her seats. I couldn't even dust them off because of the kind of seats she had. So I sat in crumbs the entire ride to work. When it was time to drop me off, she was at the wrong location once again and I had to get out and walk a block to my building. She is by far the worst uber driver and I have had some bad drivers but she is flat out terrible.",1
"Emailed them about an issue with Uber Pool (Driver name Tejan in Mitsubishi Lancer in DC metro area on Saturday night at 8:14pm) and was promised internal investigation but they didn't contact me after that, shared a trip with another 3 people instead of 2, all drunk, one of them with a drink in his hand. I am a girl and was not willing to make an issue and was hoping the driver will do something but he didn't open his mouth to stop the F Words coming from the mouth of the men instead he opened the window and let us freeze in the cold because of alcohol smell. Inappropriate touching due to us crammed in the back, their girlfriend was in between but the guy with a drink kept his arms around her reaching to my shoulder. Uber customer service is a joke.",1
"Requested a ride on my Uber app on July 3 from Eden Prairie, MN to Minneapolis, MN. The first driver went to the wrong location and didn't bother trying to contact me to see why I wasn't there; for this I was charged a $5 cancellation fee. My daughter looked at the app and noticed it said that my request hadn't gone through. She sent a new request and for some reason I was charged another cancellation fee, this one was for $6. The driver who did finally show up 30 minutes after my initial request charged me $60 for a 19 mile trip. For the return trip I tried Lyft and not only did the driver show up within 5 minutes of my request, he also only charged me $18.60! Guess which service I'll be using from now on and recommending to my family and friends? Hint: it's not Uber.",1
"I used UBER to take me from MIA to my home in Miami Beach, the car took 35 mins to arrive to the terminal. The driver that showed up was probably around 21, dressed in shorts, sandals and reeked of marijuana (did not smell it until a few minutes into ride - he had sprayed something in the car just before we got in), he got lost even though he was using a mapping APP and I was directing him. The car he was driving was a Chrysler 300, it had huge ghetto rims, I was seriously mortified being dropped off at my house. The car also had a huge speaker in the trunk, thank God I only had a small case otherwise it would not have fit and I would have needed to call a regular cab. I will not use them again, I did not feel safe and it was just a few bucks cheaper than a regular cab or car service.",1
"Uber doesn't care if you have a problem with their driver; the person on the phone promised me a $20 credit but never applied it to my account; I sent them a complaint via email, they never even acknowledged the email. I missed a flight because of the complete incompetence of their driver, who didn't speak English AND went to the Fort Lauderdale airport for the first time in his life AND doesn't know the difference between Arrivals and Departures at the airport (first took me to the airport hangar, then to the airport parking, then finally found the terminal but dropped me off at the arrivals and I missed the flight by 3min.). I spent extra $150 because of him, for the hotel and getting to the airport in the morning, not to mention the upheaval it caused me at work; and they didn't even respond to my email??",1
"More than once I've had to witness UBER drivers not following the laws of the road. For instance - one driver was driving on top of bicycle lanes and areas not meant for moving cars; another time, another driver was on a side street at a stop sign but made an inappropriate gesture with his hand and halted traffic moving along a busy road so that he could cross over despite not having the right of way. It's not just infuriating, it is beyond unsafe to have these untrained, unregulated, unruly drivers be allowed to engage in such a profession and endanger the lives of others. They might have provided faster service, and maybe this is what they think will give them better ratings and reviews, but I would rather be alive and it is beyond shameful that UBER does nothing to discourage and prevent this sort of recklessness.",1
"1 star because they don't have a 0 star option..I have a previous post about uber stranding me up at 11:00 PM and I had to walk 5 miles to get home about 2:00 AM-- I was pissed. I cancelled uber-go figure. I went to an event at the Fairgrounds in West Palm Beach and I stopped at a tabel promoting uber. I told the nice guy my issue. He reset the account tested it - all good.Need to get to Ft. LAuderdale Airport Mon.16 2016.I want a ride to the Tri Rail station.Once again I see on my cell screen, uber cars close,my credit card last 4 numbers, my pickup address and uber will not send someone because they do not recognize my number, which they have previously. So now I'm late and hit the mean streets arrive at FLL in time and now going to pay about $80.00 for parking when I get back. Way to go uber-- grrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr",1
"it would be a bit unfair to many other great uber drivers i have met but i was getting really angry after some of the drivers cancelled my trips. damn, they are suck. seriously, my stupid drivers were $#*!ing crazy. he called me to ask me where i was, i told him the pick up point i was standing at but because i was in the other side of the road, i tried to tell him that but he talked to me in his broken english with an aggressive voice. he didnt even notice the name of the streets i tried to tell him and misheard what i was saying. he hung up the phone without saying anything and i realised that he was in the wrong direction and i tried to contact him but he didnt pick up the phone. after a while he cancelled my trip. suckkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkk. i am too sick of these types of uber drivers. plz recruiting and tracking your driver selectively.",1
"They did it twice. They overcharge. Last month some driver charged me 390 when it was showing 298. He said in mine it showing this, when asked to show he said you check it again. But since my sister had booked it and I did not have the phone agreed and paid. I did not all her for somepersonal reason. But last night I was a fool I did not call my sister to confirm. The driver named swapnil picked me up from matunga at 9.45 and dropped me at powai. His car was from panvel. He was going to go without a passenger once I get down. The bill shown was 317 and he charged me 450. I gave him since I was in a hurry, instead I should have called my sister and confirmed. But is this ethically right? If I want to spend much money no matter how small or big the amount is I will do it all my will. I do not want such thugs around. Everytime overcharging. Regards Dhanada",1
"Driver never showed and had the audacity to charge me for the full ride. I paid for it, was left with no ride and super late for my event. I finally called a cab - yes a CAB which showed up, more than I can say for MARIO, Jersey City driver from hell. If you see Mario as your ride, cancel it asap. He charged me 100%, for a ride I never took. Never saw him, ever. Uber refused to credit my account,after 4 requests.. So here is how they do business: Charge you whatever they want, and never even have to pick you up or be accountable for leaving you stranded. I WILL NEVER USE UBER AGAIN! By the way, how about common courtesy for a customer who was been a loyal passenger for years, this is how they treat people. BE warned, until you face it, you won't believe it. NO CUSTOMER SERVICE whatsover. I boycott Uber and will pass the word along as many times as I can",1
"I used Über a few months ago when I needed a ride after I turned in my lease. My leasing agent made arrangements for an Über driver to return me to my home. I had no idea that Uber drivers used their own personal vehicles to transport their customers. When the Über driver showed up he was on time. However his car was another story. It was an old well worn Ford Fusion that reeked from those cheap car interior deodorizers. The car was running poorly and was making a terrible whine at freeway speeds. I was gritting my teeth the entire ten mile ride wondering if this old clunker was going to detonate at any second. Also, I didn't appreciate having to listen to a forty minutes of reggae music thumping away either. In the past I have used Yellow Cab which has always been a favorable experience. Needless to say I would never, ever set foot into another Über vehicle.",1
"Car number plate: GFI4CZK This may not reflect the whole of UBER, however, as my first and subsequentially last UBER ride, I think its safe to say this driver was enough to turn me against using it ever again. First, he tried to overcharge my us for our luggage (literally 4 shopping bags), despite it fitting with an excess of room, then he refused to take us when we refused to pay the overcharged amount. Rude and horrible experience which reflects poorly on the whole company. Would recommend UBER to start sufficiently interviewing their drivers so we, as customers, do not have to put up with such disgusting manners which utterly ruined my day. It may be amazing in the US but in the UK you are graced with the most shocking drivers who have no concept of customer service. If you use UBER and get this number plate, then save yourself the bother and find another car.",1
"Between comparing themselves to airlines and hotels at peak season who raise theirs rates which they do but never by 5.9 percent of a normal fare or room charge. Dynamic Pricking ,Surge charge and robot customer service with scripted replys they are a rip off. They are not transparent at all in their pricing. They charged $250 at 11PM for a ride that cost $30 twelve hours earlier. The driver took full advantage of the fact there were many riders looking for rides. There were also ample drivers available He raised his surge until someone accepted. There was no disclosures or an idea that he was charging $250. It is not clear what surge charge is It only states 5.9x. 5.9x of what. When you take a ride twelve hours earlier for $30 no one would expect to pay $250 for the same ride. Beware and make sure you know what you will pay before accepting a driver. They are allowed to rake you over the coals",1
"Uber can be hit or miss. On my first Uber ride:	Going out with friends from a hotel we were staying at in Savannah, Ga. They ordered a ride and it was a great experience, no problems and a courteous knowledgably driver. On the second night out: After receiving a ride downtown on the hotel shuttle, we had dinner and went out exploring the nightlife. Then we order Uber and the app said they were 10 minutes away, no problem. As we followed the drivers progress at about 5 minute out, he called to confirm our location and said hed be there shortly. A few minutes later his location was off and we did not see him on the app. We called back his number and he said he is going to take another fare and we need to find a different ride. What an SOB you are Biell! By this time we were tired and frustrated. We saw a taxi and took that back to the hotel. The moral of the story: you cant trust Uber and you need a backup plan.",1
I have recently been using uber in Panama central America it has turned into a nightmare experience not only with drivers but also with Uber Support personal. one driver charged me 10 dollars for a fare that has been costing me only 3dollars I made a complaint and instead of supporting me they blocked me from something the driver said about me. He was not the person on the profile also and obviously just a friend of the taxi Uber Driver. I found the app malfunctioned so many times that it caused distress to me. The drivers were so rude that they never answered calls or texts. One taxi driver went to wrong place and did not respond to me I waited for an hour for an arrival but he never turned up. The Uber Support personal are also rude and don't listen to your complaint properly I was actually blocked from using uber because of a driver telling lies about me. I have never been treated so awfully by a taxi service in my entire life.,1
These uber drivers have no experience and who knows if the driver is on drugs or selling drugs in his car. Government is actually making it easier for public to easily access drugs. Taxi drivers are more reliable because they go through proper training! Taxi drivers have commercial insurance and their cars are inspected by county officers whereas uber doesn't even have enough customer service representatives. What would government do if one of these uber drivers rape or kill somebody or kidnap one of their clients for ransom and who knows if it's the same driver and these drivers don't even have to go through any kind of training. This uber put lot of taxi drivers out of work! i don't think it's fair because this uber service is just extra money for some greedy people. Taxi drivers were working hard to raise their families so i think government should think about those families and ban uber and lyft forever so people can feel more safe!,1
"I waited over 20 mins for 3 different uber drivers. I got charged the cancellation fee because my stupid driver cancelled on me as it looked like on the app he was getting lost. He made like 3 u turns on the street before giving up and said I never popped out for my pickup. I'm on a public st by the bus stop. Other people were getting picked up by uber on the same corner I was and they all got their rides faster than me. The reason why uber didn't return my refund is because it past the 30 days which I understand but I didn't get my notification until it was too late and on top of that they said the fee is to compensate the driver for his time spent driving to my location. Are you kidding me? Driver never showed up. He most likely picked up another rider on the way. I was at a crowded baseball event. If we can track the driver on the uber app, uber should be able to track to see if the driver ever arrived to the pickup location. What a joke.",1
"Worst uber experience ever. The driver got on the freeway the wrong way going downtown when I needed to go uptown - didn't even realize his mistake. I was yelling at him to get off the freeway and 30 blocks out of the way he finally got off. And then I told him to stop the meter so he did, and then restarted it at that location. Ummmm excuse me, why should I be paying for 30 blocks OUT OF THE WAY. I just paid 30 extra blocks just to get back to where we started. And then I got charged for BOTH of those mistakes. In addition, when he finally got on the right freeway I had to direct his every step bc he wasn't paying attention and was on the verge of missing every freeway exit. The worst part - uber only refunded me the 8 dollars in the wrong direction and not for the extra 30 blocks back to my starting point. Horrible customer service uber. I shouldn't have to pay to get back to my starting point. I was so mad I took a taxi home instead of my usual uber.",1
Driver Gurvinder ( car Tata Indica phone number 9041202861)in Chandigarh charged me Rs 401.51 instead of Rs 74.27.I entered the correct location and I was following the GPS till the drop off. And I was wondering how the driver changed the location because it was correct till he dropped me off. driver somehow changed it after that and charged me extra. This isn't fair- please check driver's phone or how he did it. And he didn't show me that he completed the trip and Once I got out of the car he did something on his phone. Same time I thought that something was wrong . now I can't trust Uber at all. They charged me four times the fare I was supposed to pay and they didn't even confirmed me .I was shocked to see the email of 401Rs. That's ridiculous. I have been doing lot of Uber rides but now onwards I want to tell everyone to keep a check on uber drivers in India. This is very bad experience from uber. I thought Uber drivers were honest - didn't expect this at all.,1
"I was ripped off for $150 for cleaning fee. After a night out, I call uber and got a ride home. I got in the front seat and got home within 12 minutes. The ride is about $7. I got a receipt for about $7. I have no idea the driver file a charge of $150 for cleaning until I look in my credit card bill. I never received the receipt for the $150 until I complain to uber. Apparently, my driver file a cleaning fee to my ride with pictures of the middle back seat being wet and a little mess. I was sitting in the front seat. And if I don't get an alert that the charge was going to tag on, where is the avenue where I can contest this charge. The mess could have been made by the previous rider or the driver lied and file s false report. But if I don;'t get the alert right away, there is no way for me to contest this. That's why this is a scam. I will suggest all rider to take pictures of the interior of the car before leaving the car. Just to be safe so that you don't get rape by Uber.",1
"I am in Boston on business. Today, I send for Uber to pick me up after lunch at Roxy's Grilled Cheese. The first driver, accepts then 2 minutes later he cancels. The 2nd guy drives right past the restaurant. I text him to tell him he just passed by, then he cancels. The 3rd person, I text to tell her in advance that I am standing in front of Roxy's Grill. She calls and says she's there. I tell her she'e not because I'm standing outside the door (in the cold rain this whole time mind you). She says okay she'll be right there and cancels. I go back in the restaurant to tell the guy behind the counter what's going on. Recommends that I walk down to Walgreens and get Uber from there which I do after being very frustrated. Finally, someone by named Moses arrive. I tell him the story and he's very apologetic. I get back to my hotel and see that I have been charged $5 for each cancellation. I email Uber and informing them of what happened and they are refusing to credit my account. Welcome to Boston!",1
"I do not user. My business partner does. Last week in LA I agreed to let her get an Uber to take us to the airport. We saw the car pass the location once and I said, ""We're in trouble already."" The driver came around the block. Pulled up. We had a lot of bags. He didn't lift a finger to help. After loading the trunk I got in the rear passenger side door. While sitting there waiting for my partner to get in the other door I saw him put the car into Drive. I almost said something thinking to myself this guy wouldn't start going before everyone was in the car. WRONG. HE STARTED ROLLING. LUCKILY MY PARTNER, WHO COULD HAVE BEEN SERIOUSLY INJURED, WAS NOT. He stopped the car. I said, 'We're out of here.' Once again, surprise, surprise he didn't help us take anything out. UBER IS DANGEROUS. THEIR DRIVERS ARE NOT PROFESSIONAL. THEIR DRIVERS ARE NOT REQUIRED TO KNOW ANYTHING (ALWAYS RELYING ON THEIR PHONE MAPPING APS) AND THEY DON'T CARRY ANY MORE INSURANCE THAN A NORMAL DRIVER. This situation ended okay, although stressful. But the next time....",1
"After reading reviews by other disgruntled customers, I can see that my experience is unfortunately normal. I arrived at Manchester, UK airport around 10:30 pm and used the app to contact a driver. The app showed the driver was 3-5 minutes away but I waited 20 minutes before receiving a message that the ride was cancelled. Part of the problem was the waiting area was not clearly indicated and local police were not allowing cars to park so it wasn't easy to be met. However, I didn't receive a call and when I tried calling I didn't get an answer. I didn't give up and tried twice more since by midnight there were fewer cars but it didn't help. On one of the ride requests I cancelled within 5 minutes. Now back at home I see that Uber charged me $5 US for each cancelled ride, even the one I legitimately cancelled. I'm glad there's a forum like this to lodge a complaint but would prefer the message reached a wider audience since I now have read that Uber was given an F by the Better Business Bureau. The public should know they are scam artists !",1
I was with family coming back home after shopping. We called uber the first time ever. The driver probably was drunk. He took totally a wrong route and when we said it's wrong he said he has to follow the directions which were shown on his uber device. He just kept driving and suddenly we found our selves on highway. I got worried and ask him to call some one he said he can't do that. He was driving so rough and just kept going on the highway. We asked him to just stop and let us go but he said he can't coz he won't get paid then. At last we have to tell him that if he doesn't stop we will call 911. He just suddenly applied the breaks and we escaped the accident by mere inches. Finally he let us got off whrn we said we will pay him in cash and we realized we were in some different city. We took a taxi and came home. Uber charged us the extra fare and the trip cost us 130 $ what would have been just 12-15$. The worst and scariest experience of my life. So please just be careful as anyone can register with uber so you never know who you gonna trust.,1
"I wouldn't even give this ""company"" one star. First of all, their drivers always cancel my pool trips because they don't want to do pool trips and then I have to deal with the cancel fee and the trip money they take. Apart from dealing with this all the time, about a month ago I was out with a friend and my phone wasn't working so my boyfriend called an Uber for me, about a week later we realized that they had taken $150 out of the account because of some cleaning fee. They sent us a picture that looks like someone spilled water on the door and they said that was the reason. So we told them that I didn't do that and that that could be some random picture taken by their driver and they didn't care. They are not giving me my money back. They didn't even send me an invoice detailing the reason why they were taking that money, I had to ask them. So they basically stole my money. Be careful people. This guys don't care about you, they just want your money. I already deleted my account, I'm riding with Lyft from now on, I've never had a problem with them.",1
"I requested an Uber ride on Thursday the 15th 2016 to take me from my home in Apopka Vineland to a Dentist Office in Dr. Phillips. The Uber arrived and took me to an address that I explained to him did not appear to be the correct address as it appeared to be that of a private home in a private neighborhood instead. I tried to explain this to the Uber driver, however, very rudely he requested assured me that that was the correct address. I got out of the vehicle to check the place out and see if it was the office, but, the Uber turned around and left me there (IN THE MIDDLE OF NOWHERE!!!!) I contacted Uber on their contact line to tell them about their experience on repetitive occasions, however, to this day 23rd of the month no one ever did. This is quite unbelievable for me as I have been riding with Uber for a long time and dedicated; but if I ever have something like an outstanding balance with them they never play to hurry notify me for their funds. All I wanted was for someone to return my messages so I could state my case. Was that too much to ask for???",1
"Used Uber to go 12 miles, simple route from my home to office. I was quoted 12.00 on the application I downloaded. First driver shows up 10 minutes late, wants to cancel on me because he is going in other direction. OTHER DIRECTION.? I thought they were a cab service. Second driver shows up. He is driving a beat up, disgustingly smelly Nissan Sentra. I'd have sworn he sleeps in the car. He speaks zero English, drives horrible. He blew through two stop signs at which point I said, ""stop the car"". I got out, hailed a regular cab. At my office I read that I am charged $37.45 for the 5 mile, horrible Uber trip. I call their office and speak to a young man named Eric, who tells me I experienced ""surge"" pricing. So let me get this straight. You go on the ap, get a price of $12 and then because of some Uber formula, they quadruple the rate?? FRAUD. Unfortunately for Uber, I am an attorney that practices in the field of securities and corporate fraud. I will be on the phone this Monday with my contacts at state and federal levels. This company is a fraud, CONSUMER BEWARE.",1
"At about 11pm my friends and I ordered an uber that was about $30. At 3am i ordered another uber to go back to our initial destination in which we took the same route, same distance, same everything and it was $86.!!!! On top of that, it was my first ever uber ride under my name and card so I SHOULD have received a first time uber user free ride, but the app never gave me one... So obviously I googled a different promo code that gave me $15 discount. So my uber fare would have been $100! I might as well have taken a taxi or risked driving my own car for 3x cheaper than uber. I thought uber was supposed to be a cheaper, easier, efficient alternative to getting a taxi or even renting a car? I will say my experience was polar opposite. I'm never using uber under my name ever again. My driver was nice though, a nice car too. But he took 15 minutes longer than my first driver and he barely spoke English. He also took 10 minutes longer than the ETA to get to us. So here I am emailing uber back and forth asking them to honor their first time user free ride. $86 is NOT WORTH IT.",1
"My first experience with uber was absolutely horrible. A driver by the name of Wylder picked up myself and a friend and we were under the impression this was a safe, comfortable and convenient way to get to our location. It was not. The car (ford focus) was in horrible shape, the seats were tore up and covered in nasty stains. The vehicle smelled like cigarette smoke so bad I could hardly breath, and the driver was very unprofessional. He didn't use GPS and asked if we minded if he picked up a 3rd passenger on our way, we accepted since there was room, but then Wylder drove around for 30+ min looking for this other potential ""client"". He finally drove back to the location that he picked us up at and said ""I am suppose to be looking for a girl named Brittany""... umm, That would be me! He didn't seem to know what he was doing one bit. I felt very unsafe with his driving ability as he was all over the road and made sharp sudden turns in the wrong direction on several occasions. With this being my first experience with uber, I was very dissatisfied and probably wont be using the services again",1
"First, I requested an Uber driver that was 6 minutes away from me in an appropriate amount of time before I needed to get to my destination. I needed to be at the airport by 8:30 a.m. and contacted Uber at 7:40. I didn't want to have to pay for parking at the airport. When I requested the Uber driver I saw that he has 4 out of 5 stars and figured he would be a good driver.  However, the driver seemed to be lost and had no clue where he was. He passed my street four times, which my street is not that difficult to find! He kept making U-turns and turning down the wrong streets.  For a driver, you're suppose to know where you're going! And if you don't know, follow the GPS! It was an awful experience that I had with Uber. I had to pay an outrageous price for parking at the airport and was late for my flight! If the driver just knew where he was going or knew how to use a GPS then this issue wouldn't be an issue!  Since I canceled the Uber ride they want to charge me for a cancelation fee! Uber really needs to test their drivers to see if they're smart enough to use a GPS. Although, you'd think it would be common knowledge... I guess not.",1
"I requested a Uber in Paris and their driver somehow forgot to load my case that had 3 laptops, one new samsung s6 one camera and May brochures that were prepared for my business trip. I found out about it missing at the airport so we had to drive back to our office in Paris and of course it was missing . I missed my flight and so did my partner who I shared the ride with. It cost us over $700 to rebook another flight 2 days later. To make things worst, we were charged 235 euros for the trips and the time it took us to file a police report. I complained to Uber and some lady responded with simple sorry, saying I left my bag on street which of course I did not and it wasn't some public street and I recall very well telling driver to put in tunck and use back seat for larger case. Today and I am in NewYork I missed a call from Paris followed by an email which I responded to both but no answer on phone and still waiting for another call. My total losses are at least $4000 . AfterThis Uber experience I instructed my office not to ever use Uber again anywhere. A simple call or maybe a credit on bill or anything would have suffice. Stop using them.",1
"I'm visiting NYC and was attempting to get the attention of a taxi driver, and a black Lincoln Continental pulls up with a sheet taped to the right window ""UBER"". The driver said he could take me the 1.5 miles to my destination. I told him I'm not signed up with UBER but heard the rates are better than a taxi. After getting to my destination he told me the charge was $45 plus a tip and I said you've got to be kidding. I asked him to show me how he came up with that and he said he does this everyday and knows the rates. He refused to provide a fare estimate and said the fare was based on what he normally charge. I told him I think his practice is illegal and he started to use profanity towards me while speaking very loud and threatened to call NYC when I asked for the fare estimate. I told my friends about the experience after meeting them and they said the driver isn't supposed to take cash for fares because they get paid through the company. Needless to say I'm extremely upset and will never ever trust this UBER invention again. However I do hope to see the car again and the middle eastern driver. In addition, I'm going to file a report with the Attorney General, BBB and other regulatory agencies.",1
"A few week ago my boyfriend had ordered me an uber ride home. It was very late, and when I had gotten in the cab, the driver seemed really aloof and tired. I was very courteous, asked him how his night was, and the response I got was very groggy and rude. Regardless he started driving and when he hit over 50mph in a 25mph school zone, I started getting a bit uncomfortable and concerned. I asked politely if he could slow down and again, he answered with a rude tone of voice. A few days go by and I get a call from my boyfriend asking why he was charged $165.00 !!!!! The driver had accused me of vomiting in his car!!! And took ""fake photos"" and sent them to uber! It was appalling! And the photos he took looked like a crime seen it was so disgusting. It looked liked mushy popcorn and water, and the guy even went so far to smear it all over his car. Was just so gross. Never in my life have I thrown up in someone's taxi cab, and if I had felt sick, I would have politely told the man to pull over. I was not sick, I was not drunk, and I remember the ride clearly. Nothing along those lines had happened and I am shocked uber let him get away with something so terrible. Not only did he accuse an innocent passanger, but tried to steal money from my boyfriends account. TERRIBLE!!!!!",1
"I will never be using Uber again, and I registered a complaint with the Better Business Bureau. Uber charged my credit card for a cancellation when it is THEIR driver who cancelled, not me. I thought it was a good faith mistake, but what was their rectification? ""Future credits"". Appalling! They took MY MONEY, and now they want me to use their service to get MY MONEY back. My only regret is that I cannot do more than register my BBB complaint, plaster my situation on social media, and stop using their service. What they are doing is illegal. Yes, it was only $5. But, they do not have a right to take $5 out of my pocket while not delivering any service to me. Again, THEIR DRIVER CANCELLED! Is this a new business model for them? Have their drivers cancel and charge the customers money so they make money without having to spend any time delivering the service? Incredible. I have removed all valid credit cards from this account so they can't steal more money from me, as they have proven they will do so. I have deleted their app from my phone. I have emailed them to have my account deleted, and I want nothing more to do with such a shady business. I will tell everyone I possibly can about this. They are a terrible, unethical company for stealing money from their loyal customers.",1
"I am done with Uber! Have been using them for couple of months in NYC, until very recently most drivers were fine though I was never a fan of the surge pricing (I paid over $40 for less than 2 miles). Early this week I called for a car, supposed to be a 5 minute wait turned into 20 minutes. I texted and called the driver multiple times but no response. Then he cancelled the ride without my consent, and had the nerve to charge me a $10 fee! Why should I pay for no service, especially the driver was the one who cancelled, not me! He was a no-show and I ended up walking few blocks to catch a cab and late for a meeting, after wasted close to half an hour waiting! The worse thing is, there isn't a customer service number to call. I emailed Uber support and they took a while to respond. I was offer a ride credit but I demanded a refund, as I had no intention to use them again. I filed disputes with both PayPal and my credit card, then all of a sudden Uber freezed my account. They have multiple agents contacting me and asked for photo ID and credit card copy...why would I do that? It's fraud waiting to happen, and can't be legal! I have sick of the way to treat their customers and how they conduct business. I am going to file a complaint with the BBB also, I will not use them again.",1
"I have tried on 2 separate occasions to get a ride home from Uber. The first time, the driver cancelled the ride when he saw that I had a cart full of groceries. I was charged for that cancellation, but later given a $5 credit. When I went to use Uber again, the driver was in front of me, pulled up. I waved and he pulled away. I watched him around my apt complex. after that, I was charged $5 I was asked to rate the driver. How can one rate a driver when you did not even get in the car? That driver was given 1 star for not even attempting to contact me and for just driving by a couple of times. I was waiting outside before he got there. Literally, he was only 2 ft in front of me when he pulled up. He saw me and left. The last time I tried to use Uber again for a ride home from the grocery store (I contacted customer service about being left at the store the first time and was told that it would not happen again) Well, it did. The driver never showed and never bothered to contact me. He cancelled the ride once he got there. I requested Uber again, he cancelled the ride immediately. No charge for either cancellation. So, if there is any Uber driver's out who can answer this... since Uber customer support does not answer it directly. Does Uber not pick up customers from grocery stores?",1
"I was picked up from my workplace on 30/8/2017 at around 8:56 pm by cab no. TN 07 CE 8554. The trip started on my account but the drivers account was not updated. navigation kept directing the driver to my pick up point. finally after taking a full circle and wasting my time he called up customer service. the executive directed him to cancel my ongoing trip and ask me to book another assuring that the same cab will be assigned. the driver cancelled and when i booked again i was assigned a ride 20 min away. the driver asked me to get off on the street amidst a downpour. when i refused to get off away from my pick up point, while it was raining and demanded to talk to customer service again, the driver called up the office again but refused to let me speak. customer service executive told him to tell me that i am not being charged for the trip so get off. I have never seen such behavior in my life. the moment you undertake the responsibility of a trip, you are taking responsibility for our time, safety and good service delivery and in return take payment from us. you cannot waste our time, compromise our safety and then put us through discomfort and finally say 'ok we won't charge you this time'. looks like uber is no better than a bunch of scoundrels with no work ethics or standards.",1
"I happened to book an uber ride, driver accepted the ride. Even after 15 mins i din't see car moving around. I tried calling the driver, he didn't respond. I messaged on uber app, mentioning the address and asking him if he is going to pick me up? Driver cancelled after 5 mins or so!!! i was stranded with no where to go!!! this is ridiculous. Again uber charged me cancellation charges when driver cancelled the ride? This driver has 5* rating!!! When i reached uber customer service asking me to compensate as i have wasted 30 mins bcos of driver, uber says "" Its ur problem and drivers, we can't take any responsibility for driver actions!!"" Why customers are charged cancellation charges when we cancel even after 2 mins, here driver cancelled after 15 mins!!! Uber is a ridiculous company which is misusing customer data and leveraging the loop holes!! Uber should be banned in US and every customer whose personal info is leaked should be paid compensation!! Uber tracks every movement and claims its to improve trip experience!! My suggestion is first do a proper driver orientation and back verification, which will definitely improve customer experience!!! Notice that if anyone has lyft and uber, uber price is lower, but if ur using uber alone they hike the price.... they do a predatory pricing!!!",1
"My son booked me an Uber to take me to the station to catch a train to the airport. When I got in the driver started going at about one mile an hour and drove up loads of little side roads, going round in circles in completely the wrong direction and wasting a good 15 minutes. When I told him I had a train and flight to catch he suddenly said he was looking for other customers because it was a shared ride. I rang my son who said it definitely wasn't shared and to tell the driver to get a move on. He refused to. I asked could he then change it to unshared and charge the extra and he said no. I asked him to call his superior and he said there was nobody there to call. I explained that if I missed the one train an hour I'd miss my flight and there wasn't another one for seven days. Effectively I'd lose my whole holiday. He shrugged and carried on at one mile an hour. There was nothing I could do and even if I'd got out of his car he'd taken me down such quiet roads there was no chance of finding another cab. This was 3am in the morning and eventually after much screaming on my part he gave up looking for sharers - but I made it to the station with two minutes to spare and had to to try and run up numerous platform steps with two pieces of heavy luggage. I will never forget the experience and will never ever use them again.",1
"I would give Ron, uber driver from Sante Fe negative stars if I could. On Oct. 12, 2018 we requested a uber driver to take us from our hotel to Sante Fe airport at 5:30am.The driver showed up, and intrduced himself as Ron. He seemed nice enough. My wife and I got in back, and proceeded to the airport. As we're driving, my wife and I are making small talk with him(where you from, how long you been an uber driver, and so on. Said he was from NY, and had been driving for uber in Sante Fe for 4 years. He started talking about tips, which I thought was very inappropriate. He said he buys water and hand sanitizer for his customers. I said ya, looks like a wet bar back here(lol). His demeanor quickly changed. He said "" you people are invading my privacy."" HUH! You ""have no bussuiness invading my privacy RIGHT, RIGHT"" (yelling at us) SCARY! We said we're just making small talk as he continued to yell at us. Finally, I told my wife I need to record this. He heard this, pulled over, and told us to get out. It was 5:45am, 40 degrees in an area that was dark no street light or bussinesses miles from our destination.He opened my wives door, and rudely told her to get out. He threw our luggage into the street and drove away. My wife is 65, and has a sling on her arm after a surgery. We didn't know what to do. It was our first uber ride, and I'm pretty sure our last.",1
"this unprofessional driver wangjiku, I requested uber around 9:25.. if she don't have idea on pick up location she should not accept the request first of all.. but she accepted my request.. I wait for her nearly half an hour.. I'm giving her directions in the phone very clearly.. but she can not able to found me.. she even don't know the famous place DMV office of Santa Clara, I stressed her in the phone our famous apartment leasing office is exactly opposite to the DMV office.. but still waste driver did not catche me.. finally she is telling that she is going to cancel the trip in phone, but not even cancelled my trip.. because if I cancel the trip I'll get 2$ charge.. so I'm waiting for her to cancel the trip. I wait for 15 mins she did not cancel the trip. until she cancel the trip I can not able to request for another driver.. because she accepted that she can not able to pickup me, then the right thing is she must cancel the trip.. but not even its happened in this case.. so she has done these many mistakes1) she don't have idea of area where she is going to pick up 2) though I'm giving her clear directions she did not found me 3) she accepted that she can not able to pick up me after my almost half an hour request.. but still she did not cancel the trip.. 4) because of her unprofessional behavior she charged me cancellation fee.. she wasted my precious time.. my request to the management is don't give permission to the such kind of unprofessional and unexperinced drivers to drive the uber.. because customers finally get bad openion and worest experiences with the UBER",1
"When Uber runs over its customers. Buyer betware - Ueber is not all that is seems. At first I liked it. Ninety percent of the drivers are decent hard working honest people. But it's a crap shoot. I'd estimate ten percent are unscroupulous and should you ride with one of them Uber has no customer support. There's no phone whereby you can reach the driver or company. Case in point: Take Bill an apparently affable guy who will offer you a beverage on the way to your destination. Bill drives a Grand Cherokee and all indicators indicate that he is a criminal or accomplice to a crime. When Bill dropped me off at Planet Fitness I immediately noticed I left my bag containing an IPod and Bose headphones in the back seat. About $600 worth of equipment. I tried to wave him down but he wouldn't stop. Since then I have sent over 30 texts to him, the local Ueber office, and the corporate hub in Stamford. I even asked the Stamford police to investigate. As of this moment neither Bill nor Uebr care about larceny and they have no moral compass or desire for customer service. The car will get you from point A to poing B but after that your on your own. Uber won't lift a finger to help. Do you reaally want to take a chance with this company when you have your wallet, or keys, or handbag, or smartphone, or lose engagement ring on your finger? The smart answer is no. Bill is still out there. Lyft is the same as Uber. I'll check later today but smart money says they are much more conscientious than Uber who thinks its customer service is of no importance, even when expensive items disapper in one of their cars.",1
"First and foremost, in India there is no customer care service from UBER. There is just a help tab through which we can raise a complaint and that will be solved after 24hrs (taking their sweet time to respond). If a customer is in a deep trouble there is nobody to help. That pathetic ""HELP"" doesn't help actually. There were multiple issues I have faced with UBER. But, today it was disgusting. I got ill because of the $#*!ty freshener used in the cab. Apart from that driver had stopped the car in the middle, ended the trip and told me to get down at the unknown place because I was ill. And I was helpless because UBER has only ""HELP"" tab which doesn't work at all at the time of need. He denied to take me to the destination as he had some other work. when I insisted him he told I'll take you to the X place (where he had some work) and then I'll drop you to the destination. He forced me get down. I had to taxi from that place to my destination (Thanks to God I found a taxi over there), by the way I was charged for this trip which was equivalent to trip charge. Who is going to help in this. This is not the end yet. As the driver had ended the trip I was wrongly charged (more than what it is at time of booking) whose fault it was?? Driver was rude & abusive - UBER has ""HELP"" tab for your security. I have raised many requests on UBER ""HELP"" till now no help. One more important thing ""TIME"", nobody cares. Because of abrupt ending of the trip I reached my destination very late. Who is responsible?? This is not the first time I was wrongly charged, it has become usual. IRRITATED, PATHETIC, DISGUSTING",1
"My wallet was stolen out of an uber last night with my social security card inside and this was the message I sent over 4 hours ago and have yet to recieve a response. I seriously question the legitimacy of this company and strongly advise people not to use the app. I have been a big fan for almost two years but I truly believe there is an underlying issue with this company. Any other customer support system would be much more attentive to the matter and have consideration to help their customers with their best interest in mind. To Uber customer support: I received an unusual phone call from your company this afternoon that made me so uncomfortable that I had to hang up. The man on the phone had a hard time speaking clear English and said that he had contacted the driver but failed to Answer any questions pertaining to the wallet, even when asked directly. The phone call seemed like it was coming from over seas. Unless it was a mock phone call, it has made me begin to question the legitimacy of your company. I have spoken with a lawyer, the police, an investigator, and the attorney general's office. Further action on this matter will be addressed within the next few days because your customer service has failed to make the slightest advancement in helping me. I have been in contact with you for the past 8 hours and have yet to receive the smallest details about my driver, such as his last name, despite the fact that your employee has committed a felony against one of your customers. I am extremely disappointed and will continue to inform everyone I know of this situation and the how unprofessionally it has been handled.",1
"I took an Uber to the hospital but left my expensive cardigan in the car. I contacted the driver immediately from information provided in the app. He confirmed he had the cardigan. He said when he is back in my area he would drop it off. I did not hear back for a while so contacted him again. He said he would drop it off to me but I'd have to pay almost £45 for the trip or he ca drop it off at the Uber offices in Canary Wharf. I then asked he drops it off at Canary wharf. I also asked that he let me know the details I will need to collect the item. My fare to the hospital was £7 by the way. Anyway, the driver whose uber user name is ""Abobacar"" stopped responding to me. I contacted Uber and they said they had tried to contact him to no avail. So I suggested that they switch his access off to force him to come to the office but they did not respond to that request instead they pretended they could do nothing and that the driver is self employed so there's nothing they can do. I filed a Police report and the Police said they had a duty to resolve the issue on my behalf. I relayed the message to Uber but they declined. A few weeks after, Abobacar contacted them and claimed he was in an accident and that when he got the car back the cardigan was missing. So I asked if his insurance would pay for the missing item, they did not respond to that. The moral of the story is, if you have a problem with an Uber driver Uber will do absolutely nothing to help you resolve it. They appear to have a finders keepers policy. It is disgraceful. I still use Uber but will switch to a competitor as soon as I get a chance to find one. Also, I will send an invoice to Uber as advised by the police. I will follow up with feedback at a later date. Beware of ""ABOBACAR"" the Uber driver!",1
"Uber use to be great. Remember when you got the first one? It was so easy and convenient. Now, they are worse than taxi's. Surge charging to 2 or 3+ times the normal rate, app crashes, poor drivers, and above all, weak and unhelpful customer service. Now any d bag with a license can be a driver. Some of the drivers even pedal coke and weed thru Uber. Other drivers hit on girls and try to get dates. We had a driver pick us up in his pajamas once. Another driver had a tire blow out and told us there was nothing he could do about it and we basically paid double for the trip since we had to order another uber. This is no longer a company that is in control. Uber use to be great. They use to be the Nordstrom of transportation. Now, you might get the first car you click, or maybe the app will crash. Maybe the driver will wait 10 minutes then call you and cancel the ride because he's stuck in traffic. Once you get the car, cross your fingers for a cool knowledgeable driver but 9 times outta 10 the driver is out of their area and they have no idea where they are. So use gps, but it doesn't help when gps takes you the ""shortest"" and most traffic ridden route. After your trip, hopefully you get charged the correct amount... Or maybe the driver will contact uber and say your trip was longer than it actually was and they will charge you more, which I hear is happening more often now. At least taxi drivers have to work out your transaction on the spot and you know you won't be charged more at a later time. Taxi drivers are also usually driving as a career, supporting their family, barely scraping by. One of my last uber drivers was a real estate agent using uber to give out his friend number to order weed. WTF? Uber USE TO be great. Now, I'd rather just take a taxi. The uber app is convenient, but is it that much harder to dial a cab??",1
"I have been a loyal user of Uber and it has always been my go-to means of getting from point A-B. But today, I've officially withdrawn and deleted their app. Heres why: Two nights ago, I've ordered a cab for my girlfriend to get home after a huge argument around the time of 3 a.m. Keep in mind her phone died at the time. Her destination was from Manhattan to Brooklyn. The next day, she had told me she was dissatisfied with a pool customer who gave her an attitude and told my girlfriend to ""shut up"" after talking to the driver named Raja. She was tremendously upset to begin with and it caused her to get off the car a few blocks later, which took her to the 1 train. We are super easy going people and we have discovered the driver Raja, has NEVER ended the trip at the time she was dropped off- which was only 5 blocks later and had fully taken advantaged of the circumstances and drove an empty passenge car to her destination in Brooklyn. I did not fully realize this until it was too late - so I had rated him 5 stars before I got the chance to report him. Again we were in an argument so we didn't not talk until a day later. First of all she and I were not drunk at all. And I have reached out to uber and they have refused to refund me for the amount of $27. Although the money is not the issue but the dishonest driver. I will be going to Lyft from now on. I do not regret my decision. Also I notified uber and told them the details and these illiterate workers reviewing my complaint do not even respond to the problem but are confusing that I want a refund because the fare amount itself is wrong. I regret to say that Uber hires lousy drivers that take advantage of customers at 3am. and if they had looked into my transaction profile, I already spend quite a lot for cabs, theres no reason for me to go beyond for 27$ unless it was the truth",1
"Uber driver was late and stopped 50 meters ahead of where he was supposed to be. We wave him down but he doesn't come. We call him, he doesn't talk but hangs up then a couple of seconds later starts moving towards us at 5km/h I question if he is ok when he arrives as he seems either drunk or sleepy or just completely spaced out. I don't want to risk the lives of myself and my partner and her  5 year old son. Driver gets aggressive and doesn't want to drive us anymore after we waited for him for so long. I tell him not to yell as he is scaring the 5 year old and its at this moment that he cancels the trip and orders us to get out of his car. The 5 year old boy is getting out of the car with one leg on the ground when the driver decides to accelerate. This fool is playing a game with his 1500kg car and a 20kg child. We yell at him and I put the car in park so that he cant harm anyone. We advised him we will be taking it up with the Police. Its at this moment, like an infant, this driver begins playing the victim and starts pacing around his car while its in the middle of the road with doors open and hazards on. A tantrum for the adult who realises what he has done is wrong and illegal. I have contacted uber and am awaiting their call. If I'm not happy I have an active social media presence and will escalate to the proper ombudsmen as well as the police. I REALLY hope uber do not defend this dangerous and irresponsible individual and resolve this quickly. Very very disappointed and angry,.... edit: Update - uber customer service (if you can call it that) is abysmal. They are siding with the driver and banning the passenegers account whilst not revealing ANYTHING about their 'investigation' hiding behind their privacy policy. strongly considering posting the pics and videos of the driver and his car online. Customer service rep was Abhi who didn't provide us with any resolution and in fact just made things much much worse. Please don't pretend to care about dangerous behaviour if you clearly don't...",1
"We called an Uber to head to the San Jose airport as we often do. Our first driver showed up and asked us where we were going and we said San Jose airport. Immediately he said he is ""going to have to pass"" since he wants to get home soon. He didn't want to take us that far. I find this appalling - the airport is a 18 miles, 20 minute ride away. If he didn't want to accept passengers then why did he accept our ride? We wasted 8 minutes Waiting for him for nothing. We then called another Uber and she came after 5 minutes. She also asked us where we were going and when we told her the airport she said she had to pass because she didn't have proper authorization to make trips to the airport. Needless to say we were pretty pissed at this point but decided third time's a charm. The third driver was 5 minutes away. We called him right then and there and specifically asked him if the airport as a destination was going to be a problem. He said ""I think it's ok"". Then a couple minutes later we got a cancellation notice. That is THREE DRIVERS in a row that refused to give us a ride based on our destination. It's not like we were asking to go 100 miles away. SJC is the closest airport to the Fremont area and there was no traffic at this time of day. We ended up using Lyft and even with a 75% prime time charge, we knew we would get reliable service and a driver that was courteous and would take is to where we needed to go. And that is exactly what happened. Our Lyft got us there swiftly and with no issues or complaining about the destination. Uber, you have LOST this customer. I find this appalling and completely unprofessional. One cancellation I can maybe understand and brush off as a specific driver issue. 3 in a row means there is something systemic going on and that your customer service model is broken. Take care of your drivers so they take care of your customers. Completely unacceptable and unprofessional. Doesn't seem like there's enough reprimanding for drivers canceling on riders. Use Lyft or alternatives and stay away from Uber.",1
"I will and always have admitted, it's not about loyalty but business. I supported uber in the past because they were getting the job done better than the cab companies. And in a sense they are still more efficient than the dying breed of the cab industry. However there are and will continue to be more rideshare business. Look what Napster did to the music industry and look where Napster is now? Uber has gone down hill for me as this whole rating thing has gotten out of hand. I am on time for my driver, respectful (treating them the way I want to be treated), and despite not liking the tipping I still do it. I don't like the rating as it's pointless. If I give the driver a bad rating legitimately they will and have rated me poorly. Anything less than a 5/5 for a driver is ""wrong"". So the passenger gets bullied into giving them a perfect score. Then there is this tipping which I have been in the service industry and support it but UBER was all about the no tipping and now if you don't tip enough or worse on time, the driver rates you poorly. Personally, I don't care if a drive likes me or not but when my rating can impact me getting a ride, this is where the problem is. Some examples I dealt with is I had a driver in Montreal who didn't speak English and I did the best I could to communicate in French and so my rating goes down. In Phoenix, my driver was soliciting his private driver business and when I couldn't use his same thing. And most recently in Seattle one driver was so depressing talking about how she has no friends and that she doesn't know Seattle well. I had to end up using my own gps using international Data and yet now I get a bad review. I was scared to give this lady a 4/5 yet alone worse. And I have gained other example. I have supported UBER coming to Calgary and Edmonton, even when they were booted out temporarily. Now that I live near Vancouver, I was supporting them coming there as well. Now, I'm starting to change my mind. My point is now I'm considering going with other options including the awkward hailing of a cab! Regardless, ride sharing will continue to grow, the question is, will UBER be a part of this or eventually not exist like Napster, being just another company that started a trend? FYI they make it hard for you to contact them with complaints unless you say you were in an accident.",1
"I use Uber in China, Australia, India and UK and have found them to be reasonable up until now. I took an Uber in Brisbane recently and the driver was terrible. My female companion complained to the driver about his erratic unsafe driving in general, his ignoring of the navigator, ignoring of directions. Uber driver, knowing he would get a one star rating, then complained about us both making 'racist' remarks. I have no idea of what nationality the driver was, it was not even on my radar. My companion sits on University Boards and other Government agencies and is listed in top women business leaders, I also am on similar boards, travel extensively through Asia, Europe and India, we both have no racist comments to make, but we are immediately, according to Uber, guilty. Uber suspends account without discussion with me and then after only sending condescending patronizing emails 'about their community' as they are now also the new warrior and standard setter of community political correctness and protector of multiculturalism, supposedly 'unblocks' my account but it will not work. Despite trying several times to contact them to resolve, emails are answered, one of our team will be in touch, still waiting. Uber's arrogance knows no bounds, they answer to no one but themselves, they are not only condescending in their attitude, they make public claims which they do not back up. As they have to answer to know one except their own falsely manufactured 'community' which standards are set by a mutli-national based on profits, not moral or a code of conduct that has checks and balances denying a process for right of reasonable reply nor natural justice to their passengers. Their complaint service is purposefully designed to avoid human contact so they can make their morally one sided incoherent biased judgement in complete isolation and then make unfounded derogatory unable to be replied to judgments that if I knew who it was I would complain to the HRC. As they have no responsibility to local authority nor reasonable codes of contact and conduct, do not expect a fair go from Uber and do your best to out them as a self serving corporate usurer of community standards for their own profit motive while making false claims against real people of high standing in real communities, expose them for the hypocrites they are. Similar opinion? Write a review!",1
"Really Disgusting! This is the condition of National Capital Region, the biggest frustration people facing here is conveyance and moreover traffic. Nobody is hell bothered about 9-10 hours of jobs extending to 12, 13, 14, 15 hours and so on. A person going to office or market thinks to book Uber/ Ola, the first question the driver asks is DROP KAHA KA HAI- i.e. Where is your drop location. Whereas, its clearly mentioned in Ubers rule book that the driver is not suppose to ask the drop location, not a big deal the rules are as fake as the company is. After waiting for 10-15 minutes, either the driver switches his mobile off, or standing at one position he will say that I am not able to track your location or even he will just sit over it and cancel the trip after 15 min with no intimation. This is not something that happens once or twice a week, this is something that happens twice/ thrice a day. Then for all the cancelled trips they will deduct 80/- (per trip), now if a person doesnt have the time to write them the incidence happened, they will not even return the money back. Even after my last complain to uber, I attached the screenshots and sent them, these people apologized and gave me vouchers to close the matter and said that this will not happen again. But what next, everytime I should write them such detailed mail so that they pay attention to this, they dont even have a customer care. Moreover the driver has the guts to say that JAO KAR DO COMPLAIN or Okay, Jisse kehna hai kaho. Because what worst, just that they will not get the days incentives, nothing more then that. Everybody is just into money printing business, and who is the sufferer, just the common man. Frustrated person, at last when goes to an auto wala so either he will be on strike or he asks for money as per his choice, because there are no rules. Nobody is there to check. Why is the common man working so much, just to get frustrated and depressed, for he is helpless for so many things and at last he should be happy that he has money to get admitted in a branded hospital. Anybody in India can strike for any non sense thing demanded, what should a common man do. Leave all his work and strike for the thousand things that he has to face because of wrong people into business. What is the government doing. Meru and mango are out of business because of uber and ola. If this will be the case, the day is not far off that even uber and ola will be out of business.",1
"I had just arrived from the airport for my trip and was super excited to begin my vacation. However, my friend and I called for an Uber...which I highly regret now...that totally switched my happy mood into pure frustration and put me into the worst mood possible... My friend had took my phone to call for an Uber. The Uber driver was very poor at communicating his destination. After waiting around for a bit, we told him we were at the gate that he told us to be waiting for him after running there in a hurry. He was very short and rude in the manner in which he communicated. Once I told him we were in arrivals, he told us that he said to be departures and cancelled the ride, and Uber had to audacity to charge me for NO service! In the normal world, when people arrive at a destination from a flight, they get picked up in ""arrivals"". I tried to contact Uber, but apparently they do not have a real phone line to call customer support. Trying to get my money back was such a pain and ruined the whole start of my trip. All I wanted was my money back, and I probably would have been fine and a little irritated about the experience but probably would of still continued to use Uber if they had simply refunded me....However, they would only give me ""Uber credit"" to use on my next trip and still charged my card. I told them to remove the charge from my card, but they said that was ""against their policy"". I have talked with a few others that have similar situations happen to them, and they were able to get full refunds for their charged cancellation...but I don't know why refunding my card in particular was against their policy. Seems as if the company picks and chooses who they want to refund...which wouldn't qualify as a ""policy"". I guess they would prefer to lose a customer to a competitor than refund a simple $5 cancellation. That simple $5 costs them close to $200 in lost revenue just for that weekend with all of us using Lyft and other transportation services instead. My first Lyft ride was really great, the driver had even given us complimentary waters and protein bars and his car seats were actually cool massage chairs! Back to the point, Uber is not a good company...there are sooo many things that are wrong with them aside from stealing money from customers. They prefer employees that are greedy and will do anything at all costs to get ahead. I'm not just referring to the drivers (some have which have been nice to me on other occasions), I'm referring to the corporate dogs that devalue everyone around them. Here is a link to an article if you would like to learn more about the toxicity of the Uber culture... https://www.mediabistro.com/employer/blog/news/travis-kalanick-king-hr-fails-finally-ousted-uber/",1
"It's been 2 years that we are using uber, but the kind of issues we have faced in past 2 months have totally washed away the past 2 years of good experience. I'll explain the major episodes- 1. Maruti Ritz- Me and my husband were travelling from sector 57 gurgaon and sec 14 gurgaon, my husband had to get down at huda city which was midway. There are 3 ways for this route, when we asked him to take the huda route he said i can't do this otherwise I'll be in loss, I'll move according to the navigation. We told him that this concept is for car pool, but he continuously kept on saying that you don't know, i am the employee i know. He continuously kept on howling ""mai apki wajah se apna nuksan thode na karaunga"". After damn frustration we asked him to call the customer care and ask, even after knowing the fact, what he again misbehaved and said that ""hum aisa isliye karte hain taki ap baad me ye na kaho k galat raste pe le gye navigation k hisab se"". He was not silent for a min till 3/4th the way. This is highly unacceptable. 2. We both had to travel from gurgaon to delhi, it was sunday eve not too much traffic also. We booked uber thrice. The first driver 6:08 pm when we called him after 5 min he said that he cant go to delhi.. in car pool its not possible. Second driver 6:14 pm, we called him within 2 min, he also asked where u hv to go, i disconnected the phn. He again called to ask the destination, i didn't tell. He said ok, he was jst 5 min away, we kept on waiting for 10 min, no response,.when we called to check, he switched off his phn. Then also we waited and kept on calling for 15 min then finally he cancelled the trip. Third driver 6:39 pm- he too was just 5 min away , for half an hour he kept on saying that i m searching whereas he was not. At last we asked him to reach rail vihar the nearest landmark, its clearly seen in the map, finally he replied "" madam mujhe search karna nahi ata"". Then i shouted and said that i am going to make a complain, he was at rail vihar within a min, bt we had already cancelled the trip. We were late by 1 and a half hour, moreover we were damn frustrated. Finally then i booked uber from my phn and we got the cab. 3. Today in the morning, i made a request for own car from sec 57 to 14 gurgaon. A driver mahinder, hundai accent accepted the request and said that its in pool and he is going to dwarka delhi. The rider he was having was also saying that i didn't opted for pool. He asked me to cancel, so i did. I was booking it for office, in hurry. I again sent a request and again he only accepted and when i called him, he replied i have to take this request otherwise ""meri ye trip waste ho jayegi"" i don't know how. I said i havent opted for car pool, I'll be late for office how does it matters to me k apki trip waste ho jayegi. So what he replied was, he actually shouted that ""to mujhe kya farq padta hai k apko late ho raha hai"". I have actually referred uber to many of my knowns, i now feel like writing these reviews everywhere. This is just not acceptable. These are only the major issues that i hv mentioned, and it actually doesn't matter if u cut their day's incentive when we are facing so many issues with so many drivers. They take advantage of your 6 trip incentive method and it will deteriorate uber's image, u should make it km based incentive method Uber is working only becoz of customers. Dont lose them.",1

Ive been using Uber for a few weeks and I noticed several charges to my credit card for Uber trips Ive never taken. Now my account has been frozen while my credit card companys fraud department investigates. Uber literally has NO customer service.,0
Don't use UBER!!! They are spamming me and stealing personal information they do not have permission to and worse... wont do anything about it. I can't imagine what info they are taking from those who have their app or actually signed up with them!,0
"I will never understand why the drivers of the self driving UBER CAR in Tempe Arizona. Are not drugged tested, I know a few that would test positive. How could UBER put the risk of peoples, lives at risk. Also open their self up for a huge lawsuit.",0
"Their P.O.S. survey vehicle causes $4600.00 damage to my truck. They DO NOT have insurance. So, you, Mr. Driver, get your arse sued. Welcome to UBER! Michael Hung Thai Pham the subpoena is on it's way. You WILL need a lawyer. Still love Uber? Ciao.",0
"My account has been suspended by Uber (I don't know why), there drivers are always late, poor quality cars and a costumer support which never replies to your emails. A big no to Uber, your days in India are counted. May your company get dumped, Uber.",0
"The worse company in the world to get a ride from. Told us it would take longer to get a ride home, fine. They had no service for a ride home cost a ton of money to get home. Will never use this service again. Highly recommend to not use this service.",0
"I requested an uber from my home 10 minutes from DTW on Saturday July 16 at 6:45am. 11 minute eta. 8 minutes into it, I had my son check on it THE TRIP was cancelled. OMG what a predicament I had. Ended up driving myself. Cannot trust to do this again.",0
"They charging unfair money for the trips! I had 3 miles trip which is about 15 minutes and they charged me £15.41 pounds! When they showing how much would cost your trip on the app, it was from £5 to £7 pounds, but they charged £15.41!!! Liars and thieves!!!",0
"I had a pre scheduled uber ride on 02/22/2019. I received a notice that the UBER driver, Charles had arrived at my home, but no UBER car outside. I walked the block to locate the UBER driver with no success. Then. UBER charged me for a missed ride. Bad UBER!!!",0
"Worst experience of contacting Uber customer care. I left a sunglass and called within minutes of dropping, however they failed to connect the driver immediately and later sends an email saying they didnot find anything. This is ridiculous and highly unethical.",0
"While in San Diego I got three charges in Chicago in one evening for Uber. Two of the charges were visa, one PayPal. Uber would not respond to my emails whatsoever. However both visa and PayPal refunded my money. Now how do you suppose my Uber account got hacked?",0
"Too much words are needed to explain about this big scam ,whether you are a driver or a rider. I have experienced both sides. Uner is collecting your information and selling them and ripping off the driver and the rider both! Stay away from this evil at any cost !",0
from last 3 to 6 months i had a couple of rides with uber but in the last ride they charged me 50% extra money and they are not giving proper explanation ... this looks like a uber is a big scam. this organization will be stealing money bit by bit .. Becareful guys !,0
I was so excited to work for uber got a nice new car been driving now for 2 months but every nirte I come home so depressed I make about 6 bucks an hour pay for gas please do not be a driver I do not drive for uber any more some one is making big bucks but NOT THE DRIVERS,0
$129.00 to travel across town in Boise. About 10 miles. 1st time used. Saturday on a non Holiday weekend. Mobile app is crap on advising you of your total cost until you get home and your email presents the shocking damage. Took over 13 minutes to get picked up too. SCAM!!,0
"I would like to unsubscribe from Uber's emails but after contacting their support, speaking to several people and several messages back and forth I am still getting their promotional emails. They claim that they have done all they can to unsubscribe me but the emails persist.",0
Uber is a big fraud . I live in Qatar and visited US where I booked uber on 31st May . I got update on 13 June that I have been charged 150 dollars for cleaning. I was with my colleague and it was only 4 minutes trip and no mess has happened They are big fraud . Big time fraud,0
My account was hacked and my card was charged twice. When I tried to dispute the charges I couldn't get through by phone and I didn't get an email back. I had to call my bank and they disputed the charges but still could not get in contact with Uber. I will never trust them again.,0
Uber owes me over $600. They say I must have a checking account even though they have put money in my savings account after my first complaint. I do not have a checking account. They are illegally holding my money and I am hoping to get a class action against them. Lee from Austin,0
"Uber is pretty good for riders - a real scam for drivers, wear out your car for less than minimum wage in most cities - - the amount they ""claim"" one can earn is a lie and a few drunk riders will bring your rating with Uber so low they will fire you - - thank you Uber for firing me",0
"Uber takes the WORST routes! They will take you in circles, then bring you back to your starting point to pick up another rider to make $2. LYFT is no better! Cant wait for more competitors to join the market. Maybe then theyll take their customers best interests into consideration.",0
I tried to use the Uber app to schedule a pickup at the EWR Marriott hotel in NJ. The app REFUSED to pick me up at the hotel and wanted me to hike all the way to the terminal for a pickup. Why bother with Uber; I can just get the hotel to call a taxi that will pick me up at the door.,0
Uber tempt you with a cheap fare when you request the ride only to find they charged you double to the same destination and no tolls. Also the driver cancelled the job and they still charged me. When I complained they said they refunded me but it's not true and never received any refund,0
"On a recent ride there were 5 of us jammed into a little Uber car with our suitcases and the ride cost me more than the taxi I took going to the airport. Watch out for extra charges, user fees. The company is very greedy. Just imagine how much the company made off the five of us per hour.",0
"Uber drivers are amazing. However, uber as a company not so much. The app rarely gets my location correct, the spotify collaboration... doesn't work, the gps on the app sends drivers the round about way. It. Sucks. Uber I once thought you were great. Now I think... Get your $#*! together.",0
My 18 yr old daughter a college student was charged $250 for a ride that cost $45 on the way there. It was her first time using UBER and was not informed of the surcharge which they said was 2.8X but by my math 5X+ her cost their. There should be laws to prevent such gouging - SHAME ON YOU>,0
"I was ripped off many times, overcharged by uber and when want to ask or complain, they of course have a bridge to nowhere type of system where it is impossible to actually state your complain, it is categorized where you can not find the right button. It also seems there is no real response",0
Uber is an absolute rip off. Their price guides never meet their much higher fares charged. You never know what they charged you until you check your credit card. Most times more than a taxi. Rip off on nye was mind boggling. I won't be using them anymore. Best to see an honest fare on a meter.,0
I was charged $215 for a half hour trip. My phone died and I never relized I was going to pay that much. They suck you in with a cheap fare short distance then thay hit you hard with a big fare. Completely unfair and dishonest system. I will tell all my friends and family not to use this service.,0
"I book hotel to airport. I booked for 48sar and finally it costs 84sar when I received the email. This is more expensive than a normal cab. This is more expensive than the official cab which I took when I did the single trip from airport to hotel. Uber, you messed up, you start to be like Ryan Air!",0
The founders and management of Uber have gotten rich on the backs of poor drivers who don't know how to calculate the full cost of driving for Uber. They make a very tiny percentage or they often lose money because Uber pays them LESS than the true cost of driving and maintaining a vehicle in the U.S.,0
I do not recommend this business to anyone. This company is fraudulent and withdrew without my permission 455.39 from my checking account. If you have kids and bills don't use the uber app or service. I use my card online often and this has never happened to me before I rate this company a big fat zero.,0
"Our 15 year old boys hailed an Uber ride late Friday night (February 24, 2017). Well.....let's just say they aided in our boys running away from home. Check out their rules, and it says you need to be 18 to call for a ride, or have parental permission! Umm....not 18, and no permission!!! Good job Uber!!!",0
The worse company EVER! A GROUP of thieves. Was a complete nightmare That I went through. I booked to Canada from Orlando and they sent me to New York. I found out when the confirmation came. Took over 2 hours on the phone been hang up. And I couldn't have my money back on time. DONT EVER USE THIS COMPANY,0
For a ride downtown it was $19.84...to get us home on an event night they were going to charge us 6 to 7 times the normal rate which would have been $120 to $140 ish. They should be ashamed of themselves...I certainly will not recommend them to anyone. They should be required to disclose this information.,0
"App login issue, registration issue. Customer service has no phone number. To solve simple problems, you will see several non sense emails. No one will solve your problem. Bottom line , bad company, they do only show as a good customer service but have no solution for customer. DONT USE UBER, ITS A TROUBLE.",0
my promos return back while i can ride my promos return back while i can ride my promos return back while i can ride my promos return back while i can ride my promos return back while i can ride my promos return back while i can ride my promos return back while i can ride my promos return back while i can ride,0
Uber is thirsty for money. Even when they know they cannot pick you up within the time stated they make you wait and charge you a cancellation fee if you dare to choose another option. This company is on a downward spiral. Up with Lyft. Down with Uber. How dare you disappoint a customer during Mardi Gras season!,0
Tried driving for them going on two weeks still waiting on the decal I ordered twice. By time it comes I won't be trying to drive for them. Guess it's better then a two week wait from lyft on a background check. Not worth it. Y time you get everything it's the same as waiting 2-3 weeks at a new job for a paycheck.,0
"In the past two weeks, I used Uber twice for one way riding same distance. The price for first time $12.00 and the second time was charged for $54.00. Next time, I rather take taxi with meter and know what you will pay for. Uber should have price quoting before pick up. Reg.is needed to review their fare practice.",0
After a night out got a taxi through uber at normal rate twice and both times said on route but then cancelled the pick up for no reason? Then the price surge occurred and we were picked up and dropped off meaning a £25-30 dare then became over £60 customer support not existant uber is dreadful company to deal with,0
"Not only is ""UBER"" car service a fraud but actions that are allowed by its passengers are criminal!!! Recently, my friends son was jumped by passengers riding in an ""UBER"" vehicle. When the incident happened I couldn't believe a ""reputable"" car Service would allow such criminal acts and not file a report. So sad...",0
We did get a quote ...it was for after a concert double check and triple check because we had heard they change the price $40 was the price but then they told us at the time of pick up it as $350 because of the time ...that was in the quote ? Suck and scam Do not know how they get by with this Something needs to be done,0
"I took an UBER from Pacific Heights to the SF airport and it cost $85.00!!!! That is outrageous! I was not told of the charge, as the driver picked me up at the airport, then stopped at my hotel to get my suitcase and then to the airport. The traffic was bad, but he should have told me it would be $85.00, that is crazy!!",0
"I will never use Uber again! My 20-25min drive turned into $197. Had I known this price upfront I would never had stepped a foot into that uber car!!!!! Where as my regular cab ride on the way back was only $51.....Talk about a scam, I will be cancelling this credit card charge and disputing the charge. Out of control!!!!",0
"On app Uber lures u to money making areas but once u get there,your riding around wasting gas hoping you get a rider. wear and tear on your vehicle....good luck with that. Uber dont care.they stress u to drive but wont help u with money to fix car. Lyft Looks Out. If u wanna drive,Lyft pays better than Uber and less bull$#*!.",0
I did an estimate on a trip that was supposed to only be an estimate price for $20. I didn't realize I picked a sub so after the ride I was charged $68.00. Why would I want to pay $68 if the taxi would of onlyour costed $30 I used Uber for over an year Iat not use uber anymore that was an outrageous price to pay for an $30 trip .,0
"I used Uber last year and loved the service. I again ""attempted"" to utilize Uber last night (Halloween) for my 16 yr old daughter. Guess what? She ended up stranded miles from home due to YOUR inept incompetence. Needless to say, our Uber days are over. We will be utilizing Lyft from this point forward. Choose your merchants wisely!",0
"If you are thinking of making extra money with UBER, think again! It is impossible to contact them, no phone, no direct email. I drove a rider; Uber's app is difficult to navigate, it didn't register and afterwards they said the rider canceled!! So even though I did pick up and deliver, I did it for NOTHING!! Now who can I complain to?",0
I used uber for the first time last night and was quoted $41 it was going to cost me and when I got home and the driver showed me how much it cost and it was $116. The driver could not believe it and neither could I. Been fighting with uber back and forth over email. I just want to talk to someone and not this email $#*!. NEVER TAKE UBER,0
I will no longer use uber tried 4 times today 4 times to request ride it kept telling me to confirm my payment which it did 5 count them 5times EXTREMELY UNPROFESSIONAL GIVE DRIVER STUPID DIRECTION AS a company menat to serve the people IT DOES JUST THE OPPOSITE WHILE CABS A MORE EXPESIVE THEY DO NOT ON a daily basis screw up like uber does,0
"Has a driver with Uber you can except more bad rides. The driver make very little and the company treats them like crap. Harder then a route canal with a dentist with shaky hands to get help. I did this part time and as a Manager of drivers in my other job, I can tell you if i treated them the way Uber does I wouldn't have any and wouldn't have a job.",0
Iam really disappointed with uber charges!! For the last 2 months have been calling uber in different routes but unfortunately when I agree with charges uber declares for a journey in the end I get a higher charge of $3-$5 without any explanation!! Only todays trip where I had limited funds on the account my charges had no issue!!! This is cheating!!!,0
"Today I booked with Uber and when the app showed our car was due in 5 minutes, we went downstairs to wait. 30 minutes later we were still waiting. During that time, the estimate of arrival bounced back and forth between 3 minutes and 11 minutes. We gave up when it became clear that we would not be picked up in time to reach our destination before it closed.",0
"Yes a customer gives a driver a back comment to be evil, as that the driver was too slow when only was a the speed limit. What the driver has to do race in the street to make the passenger happy, and get a ticket for speeding. The driver got suspended for a week, and forced to take a class for $60. The drivers are making money for UBER to be treated like crap.",0
"The driver took ages to approach the location, didn't show up, cancelled my trip.. and then Uber charged me a cancellation fee. They wouldn't refund the wrongly charged cancellation fee back to my credit card. They rather hold it ransom instead, on my ""Uber account"", as if I was expected to use their miserable service ever again. They are a bunch of unethical morons.",0
Uber charged me 3 times for a trip I took three weeks ago. Then once I wrote into help which was no help they charged me 6 more times and never replied or re-funded me my money. I had to call my bank and dispute charged and ban Uber from taking out of my account They are thief's and hope they do not last long. I have now downloaded Lyft they seem to have better service,0
Uber takes out all hard earned money of the driver and encashs persons need They deduct around 35-40% for the fate charges For ex if the fate was $10.00 for 3 miles 20 min journey in downtown Uber takes close to $4.00 and gives the uber driver $6.00 In the $6 driver spends his time drives his own CST on his own maintenance and buys gas in his own Please don't take uber,0
"I began to sign up with Uber thinking it would be a good way to get some money. For some reason they could not read my registration. The many texts regarding this has been annoying. To the point that I asked that they stop texting, emailing, calling. this was the wrong thing to do since I have had so many texts all night from them. I just wish they would leave me alone.",0
I have asked Uber 5 times via email for directions on creating an Uber account. It will not let us do it because it wants a mobile phone number. We are retired and have no need for a mobile phone anymore. I need to use my house phone but it rejects it. How can I utilize Uber services without having to purchase a mobile phone. It does not make any sense. Can anyone help us?,0
Ubers refund policy is a joke; dont waste your time. I had a very legitimate claim and Uber has been sending me back and forth numerous emails for just 16 dollar and they will just play you around. I always thought Uber is a reputable reliable company until today when i tried the service and realized how much they are fraudulent and their site designed to steal people money.,0
So the uber estimate said that it should cost me no more then $4 . Well I went 1.94 of a mile an the lady charged me 4.85$ 85 cents more then the intended price. I went 2.2 miles an back for 4$ just a week ago. This is preposterous for 4.85$ I could have just Walked or taken the bus an it be cheaper to go to an from my location . They ripped me off I will never do uber again,0
Maurice Heyliger in Atlanta area - THIS IS YOU BUDDY! Quote a 40 dollar ride and then upcharge to 150+ afterwards. Nicely done. As you can read from the posts this seems to be a standard business practice. Next time on Shark Tank you can thank that POS Chris Sacca that says he invested in Uber all the time. This company will eventually fail on its own or be sued into oblivion.,0
It is a ripoff for both drivers and riders. Uber gets the money and your car and pocket suffers. Not to mention the safety issues. I drove for Uber for two days; 4 rides. Up to 19 per hour?? Not even close! More like 2.00 per hour not mention you only get paid for the ride to the riders to their destination. The rest is on you! http://digg.com/video/uber-scam-rip-off-for-drivers,0
"We used über to take us to a concert in Columbus, OH. The driver there charged us $25.94. Said uber said he can charge 7 times the regular rate but he wasn't going to do that. The charge for the driver home was $148. He said he was allowed to charge 8 times the regular rate due to high demand. I personally feel that is not how you treat your customers and will never use uber again.",0
If you think you're going to make money with uber / think again this is the new form of a slave labor. as a taxi driver you will receive half of what you used to make with the other company if you currently drive for uber you better stop now..they don't care about you . I did it for a year and its not getting any better the price was reduced and the search pricing is a scam goodbye over,0
"UBER is big big FRAUD company. As a driver,,, please do not sign for uber. They trying to attract the people by offering cell phones, cars by collecting the monthly payments are three times of actual companies. If anyone has taken vehicle and phone thru uber.....their life is going to end so soon. No contact numbers, uber app mileage is different than actual distance. No proper management.",0
DO NOT GIVE THESE PEOPLE YOUR CREDIT CARD. I set up their app just so I would have it handy and had to give them my credit card to do so. Months later I got a charge from them even though I never used them. I called their customer service and got a recording saying the number was out of service. I called the number from my credit card charge and was told to leave a message on their web site.,0
In Salt Lake City my destination was changed after I entered uber car. I confirmed with uber driver my requested destination at my pickup location. Then again when he passed the street I going to. He took me to the location on app that I had not requested. I jumped out of the car fearing for my life. Do not drive off with any car service without seeing your requested destination on their app.,0
"We arrived in New York via Penn Station and the first yellow cab drive was a jerk...the next ride on offer was a Uber car. Whilst the driver was friendly, he charged us $25 US to go a short distance...having caught a cab to the other side of New York and only charged $15 US it was obvious we were ripped off...not a good way to introduce visitors to New York. We won't be using Uber ever again.",0
A friend of mine was drinking to much and needed a ride. I tried to use uber to pick her up . The app no longer allows you to change the pick up point . It was horrible my friend ended up walking drunk on a dark country road for over a mile before I could pick her up .They have no clue as to why people need taxi service . and are so user unfriendly . I downloaded Lyft at least they have a clue,0
"I just spent 45 minutes of my life trying to simply update password and my 'Home' information on the Uber phone App. What an absolute joke. I was in a hurry to get somewhere and made the huge mistake of trying to give this company another chance... all they managed to do was to waste my time. Save time, money and frustration... use Fasten, Lyft or anybody else. This company just needs to close!",0
"We took an uber home thinking it would be better than driving. It was a 25.09 ride which is absolutely fine, but a surcharge of over 50 dollars is absolute ridiculous. Our trip was 12 miles and we paid over 77 dollars. I have tried to call, email, anything to talk to a person and nothing has happened. Uber is absolutely ridiculous with the way they charge people. So disappointed in the company.",0
"I have used Uber pretty much since it was introduced. However, now that Uber tracks your location EVEN if your phone is OFF, i'm out. I will never use Uber again until they change this policy. Deleted it from every device in my family and am passing the word to everyone who will listen to do the same. If your a driver and want my business, switch to Lyft. Big brother is watching and his name is Uber",0
"I waited for almost 1 hour, every time I looked the app kept giving different time updates so I waited since it was rush hour after all in Atlanta. After 1 hour I contacted the driver and he claimed to not have any record of my request and that he had already picked someone else. He kept putting me on hold and told me to take up with Uber. I will NOT use this company again, the app has been removed from my phone!",0
I am an uber driver and all I can its sh*t for the money and you get sh*ty customers Rating is a load of bull**cks. Why would I want to rate my rider what difference is it gone make to me or them Why rate driver just why ... Who gives Damn ? I mean you go from a to b don't matter who takes you Overall I would not recommend any1 to work for uber as it is low pay drivers have no advantage Rider can claim everything,0
"My upfront price was $44.56 last night when I got out of the car at my destination. I woke up this morning to at price of $71.71. I did not authorize that amount. I wish to be refunded, and to have my account closed. I will not tolerate shenanigans. I will also write a review about this incident, and I will look for a class action law suite against Uber. Thank you in advance, Broadway Photographer James T. Rainey",0
Requested a Uber in Las Vegas. Was standing in front of the Uber designated pickup spot for hotel when ordered Uber. Contacted driver after waiting 25 minutes. He said I was at wrong spot hung up on me and cancelled my pickup and charged me. Uber refuses to refund that charge. I've contacted them several times and they send me the exact generic email saying no refund. Horrible customer service will never use Uber again.,0
"I referred a friend to Uber and got a free ride. I made a ride and my free ride didn't work. When I asked Uber to reimburse me they said they'd block my account for some violation they couldn't explain. I asked questions and tried to clarify the case, and they sent me 5 (!!!) absolutely similar emails with NO answer to any of my questions. So this is how Uber support works and this is what you get for referring friends.",0
"We ordered Uber XL for our party of five. A Toyota 4Runner was assigned. It did not have seating for five plus a driver. We had to cram four in the backseat. Several emails between Uber and myself resulted in a ""too bad, it's what you ordered."" So we paid premium rate for a service we did not get. Uber XL says parties of 1-6, but beware. You are responsible for knowing if the vehicle assigned will seat the number in your party.",0
"too many scammers goes in there, especially payroll assistant/processor be aware...",1
Upwork is the worst site I have ever used. 2 times I was robbed by the freelancers they suggested I hire. $#*! Upwork,1
The freelancers consistently charge more than agreed- there is a lot of fraud and bad work on this site. DO NOT USE IT,1
bull $#*! site i ended up getting ripped off for almost a thousand bucks :/ watch out poor quality work and no one is on your side ever.,1
AXhive solutions are scammers! Beware! They are not professionals and will leave you with nothing. The little work I did see was subpar.,1
I hired a Freelancer whom didn't do his job- I disputed with upworks . Upworks wants to charge me $275 to dispute. Upwork is scam their freelancers are scam too,1
Stay away from these freelancers: Modern Developers who is Navneet Kaur and Mahesh Salunkhe! Upwork does not do any background checks on these guys and they jump platforms to stay avoidable.,1
"If you pay Upwork to see the bids made from other workers, there are so many workers from impoverished countries so the ""low-balling"" of bids, causes very little money to be made, if you're even chosen.",1
This site is a rip off! I cancel a milestone - thanks to a freelancer who did not read the job description. Upwork took a 10% fee off the total sum saying they had to process it. What an absolute joke of a site!,1
Paid a so called electronics engineer to design a PCB only to find it didn't work after getting a quantity made up lost thousands But the freelancer is still working via upwork Perhaps it should be called upscam,1
"If you want put your money in the sea, please go to upwork. They are stealers who stole my money. I hired a freelancer who didnt complete the work but upwork has released my deposit which was in the upwork escrow without my consent.",1
"As an employer there's many scammers and real bad freelancers, who's making quick money and run. As a freelancer you competing with millions of other freelancers, with no chance to get any work. So either way I wouldn't use this platform.",1
A complete scam site. Freelancers claim to be able to complete work they can't do and they get paid even when they don't deliver! It's impossible to remove sensitive data like credit card details when you try to close the account! Don't use ever!!!!!!,1
do not use this company if you pay a freelancer and they do not deliver the product you will not get your money back without going though a ton of red tape and you money is lost . You could lose 10k faster in Vegas with better odds. Stay away. Its a scam....,1
"Upwork is a waste of money and time. I hired a copy editor, who actually left out a sentence in the first paragraph of my book. I next hired a proofreader who was so bad I made her give me my money back. If you want either, find someone through word of mouth.",1
A Freelancer threatened to hack me after I left a 2 star review to match their horrible service and attitude. I reported this to Upwork with a screenshot of the conversation and they did nothing and their account says 100% success rating. Do not trust their ratings!,1
"Elance, if you want to lose your money or pay for NOTHING then use Elance. I just lost $1500 for nothing - the freelancers there make there money so easy, you request something and they give NOTHING... Please please do not be stupid like me and use this terrible service",1
I hired a freelancer on upwork to make an app for me.The freelancer logged manual hours and upwork released the funds to him with out asking me if i received anything in return which i had not.So in turn i lost $600.00 and they are putting the blame on me WHAT A SCAM SITE IT IS,1
"A freelancer got my money there without delivering the job. I asked them to stop releasing money to him. They told we can't. That easy, you can go to this website, as a client to release a first milestone to you and then you ca run away without any probem. Their supports are sucks.",1
"As a contractor I have lost hundreds of dollars when the freelancer disappeared. And as a freelancer I did not receive their help in recuperating money from a contractor I worked for. Sh*t customer service, no safety provided but damn do they ever forget to charge their big commisions? Never!",1
I had excellent experience on elance so I decided to give its so called new verion upwork a try. I hired workers for several projects but each time my experince was pathetic. Possibly this site is crowded with fake workers who show great work on their profile but actually deliver crap. Will never recommend.,1
"i hire a freelancer with very good skill, i invest $5490 to get my website done for company, but suddenly the person disappear and i cant get my payment back, upwork saying the freelancer account suspended and now i m in middle of work, :( very bad support very bad company, care dont put large amount on them",1
Freelance ripped me off totally and Elance will do NOTHING about it. Elance customer support tells me they can give refund my money IF THE FREELANCER would contact them. Well that makes no sense. The freelance ripped me off and so did ELANCE. What a bunch of scammers! Going to ripoff report and let them know too of how bad ELANCE has been.,1
Avoid Upwork at all costs when you require a software project. My experience is that Upwork will protect scammers and allow them to keep on working after taking your money. Software projects require time to iron out all the bugs and the Upwork platform will not allow you to modify reviews when freelancers do not complete their work but keep your money.,1
"Not superb though, not user friendly either. I am satisfied because I found cheap labour but not quite satisfied with their performance. At first they were excellent but then started to let me down more and more. I ended up doing the job myself which is complete opposite of why i joined in the first place. Never mind, I am sure someone better will come along.",1
This is the worst site ever. Any freelancer I've hired from there has ruined things on my site and has cost me double to have their work fixed. Anybody can sign up and say they have experience. To prove it I signed up as a SEO specialist (I have zero experience) I was given rising talent status by upwork for completing a couple things on my profile. Stay away!,1
"By any scale a WORST COMPANY. This Company's motto is to how to steal your money. As a Client, you will come across Freelancers who will falsely promised you to set a Milestone to have the Project delivered. Then these Freelancers will take your money and will run away. They make false promise and UpWork is completely involved in this Practice. Don't do any business with UpWork",1
"Don't waste your time with this. I had 2 ""pros"" accept my project. The last guy quit. Said it was to hard and had other jobs coming in. I'm very disappointed in eLance. Both said they could knock it out in a few days. The first guy was working on everything I had asked him not to mess with. The second guy kept wanting more money. Then he quit... I've wasted a month with those guys.",1
they approve payment to freelancer without my approval and the freelancer did not do the job nicely. And the help center asking me to pay 290usd to help me to get the money back. i hate their help center. IF you going to use upwork do not pay dispute money without the job complete so they can not steal your money. Guys use separate credit card for the payments just use the exact amount.,1
"I sent refund request, that has been accepted by freelancer. I have filled a statement of work etc, specified i get a refund if something goes wrong. Freelancer did accept the refund request of mine, however since they do not have money on their account i have to wait till they do top up their account, which obviously never going to happen. What da f**k is refund request for if not to get your m*********g money back?",1
"There is not any security at Elance, no control over freelancers. I was stolen 500$ by a scam freelancer. They use automatic PayPal payments, disappear in a few days and delete the profile. You can start a dispute but there's nothing to do. PayPal wil request a refund to Elance, the will reject it and they will tell you to dispute with the ""disappeared"" freelancer. DON'T work with this company, they should be shut down.",1
"I wasted 2 weeks working with a fraudulent freelancer on Upwork.com I didn't notice until after he got nearly $1500 out of me. Just 1 day he disappeared and stop responding to my messages. Worst thing about it is that Upwork refused to refund the money! No worries, I just called my bank to handle it but now I'm behind schedule and need to find a reputable freelancer to create my project. Beware of these scam artist, they are everywhere!",1
"Just a short note. I have hired over 23 freelancers and completed over 30 jobs on elance in the last 4 years. I had a problem with one freelancer and attempted to resolve via their very confusing process. I could NEVER get anyone to speak to me on the phone. In short, I paid a freelancer $219 for work that was never performed correctly and Elance did not speak with me to resolve. They would only send emails. Not acceptable to me. I am moving away from them.",1
"The last job posting I put on upwork resulted in multiple DIRECT calls to my phone, work email address, skype address, personal email address, google chat. They all mentioned they saw the job posting on upwork and its the only place I posted. Its overwhelming and I will not use upwork again for a job posting. They found the email of a consultant to my business and emailed him. Unless you are lonely and like contact from strangers who want you to hire them, stay away.",1
"Had small job started by freelancer. Was so bad I fired him. He billed me for $80 for time spent working on a project which he never delivered, and for sample work that was so bad I couldn't even use that. Contested with PayPal, which was denied. Disputed with Upwork, which was denied. Beware - PayPal protection absolutely useless and Upwork protection a joke. DO NOT USE. There are others...or you get someone local that understands English and has some degree of ethics.",1
"UPwork is a total rip-off. Two weeks and $160 hours later, I find out that the project my programmer said he can do, is still not fixed and there is no hope that he can fix it. If you value your blood pressure and your wallet, do not use this system...there is a reason they are so cheap...to scam you into using them. Add Upwork to the latest scams on the Internet along with diet fads, and get rich quick schemes...(except for them...they are probably laughing all the way to the bank.)",1
"Elance has 161 complaints with BBB in last 3 years! FACT! Do not use their services. They provide no protection for you and allow their freelancers to do what ever they want! I paid over $5000 for a website that never worked, they won't do anything and will continue to allow this freelancer to take money from unprotected customers. Plus this freelancer held my passwords ransom unless I gave them a good review. BE WARNED! ELANCE can't protect you! *I would have left no stars checked if I could have!",1
"I used Upwork for the first and it was the last time. Their freelancer delivered not functional website, I asked for a full refund, they said I need to ask freelancer. When I contact him for refund, he blocked me. I contacted Upwork again, sent them all necessary information about the work I was promised and what I recived, all messages...and after several emails they said that they just connect freelancers and clients and they cant do anything about my case. I lost my money and received very very poor website.",1
"Been hiring freelancers through Elance for close to 3 years now. Found some great freelancers and some not so great freelancers, But my beef is with the site itself! It is full of bugs that cost me a lot of my time and it has been going on for a long time now. Today I looked through the site for a place to write to them about their bugs and to my surprise there was no way to contact them. No phone number, no email, no form to fill in. Or it was so well hidden that... But seriously, in this day and age you do that?",1
"I want to know which FEDERAL AGENCY I can ask to investigate this group. They take money into escrow and then it magicallly disappears. Freelancers write with complaints about money and completed work disappearing. The site is IMPOSSIBLE to navigate, with tabs and labels that make no sense. Oh! Do NOT enroll or sign up. So much of my outsourced work has been lost, incomplete, late or never even received by the bidder. On a side note, the freelancers are non English speakers who really cannot handle even mildly sophisticated projects.",1
"Many years ago I had used oDesk to find freelance website developers. I had some success and was general satisfied. Then Upwork purchased Odesk and it all changed. The biggest change was in the trustworthiness of their freelancers and the way they made it impossible to work with their freelancers to manage websites without risking getting ripped off by the freelancers. I finally did get ripped off by a freelance so bad I will never use them again. If anyone wants to know who the Upwork freelancer that scammed me was, feel free to contact me at 570 975 5805",1
"please do not use this website, is the worse nightmare. bad customer service, over a week with a issue. this people would tell you pay me by hour so they spend incredible amount of hours working in something would take less that 1 hour, i paid for 50 hours, the person told me that they were going to make my website, I stopped the work because after billing me for 50 hours the only thing they did is send me a template and change 5 picture in the template, and that was their work, after 2 weeks, my website got not changes and they are refusing to issue a refund.",1
"Good luck to you if you hire through UpWork. Once you are set up to pay your freelancer and money changes hands, it's GONE. UpWork will not give you a refund, even if the freelancer overcharges for the work done, conducts themselves unprofessionally and compromises the security of your website. UpWork says that unless the freelancer agrees to a refund, there is nothing they can do. So why use UpWork? I am not sure, as you'd be just as well off to throw your money at someone on the street corner. There is no protection against unskilled, unprofessional freelancers on UpWork.",1
"Got linked up with a freelancer and it was going well until I realized there was no way this person could accomplish the task, and then you are just screwed. The freelancer was making 8th grade graphics, literally thought it was a joke when it first was submitted. I would never use this site again because of the process, you should get a trial period to see if the person can actually do what you are looking for. Do not ever use this site, and if you do then know how much risk you are taking. I'm sure there are good freelancers on there but few and far between, good luck hunting.",1
"We got ripped off by our freelancer. Elance released the funds they held from us to the webdesigner even though he had never finished the job. We called the customer service: unfriendly, unprofessional, giving us the feeling that they did not care and above all they did not do anything to get back our money or to make sure our website would be finished. In the end we even got charged for copyright violation by GettyImages because the webdesigner had used stolen material from the web. I do understand all the good reviews from freelancers: they can basically do whatever they want!",1
"Upwork hires criminals. I discovered this when I found that one of their freelancers has 3 convictions of violent crimes. UpWork responded that they do not discriminate and what a freelancer does with their personal time is not their business. However, some freelancers meet face-to-face and could be using Upwork to cause harm or commit more crimes. UpWork has no idea if any of the freelancers they ""connect"" with others are violent offenders, predators, sex offenders, pedophiles, etc. because they feel they have no duty to let you know this information. I would never recommend them.",1
"I spend over $25000 on Upwork but when I hire (most Indian) freelancers they where all a disaster. No deadline reached, they lie about the work which is not done to get a payment, they log in for more hours. They drag the project to keep your for long time to benefit the payment. I hired a Indian company who had a good feedback on Upwork. But then I found out they gave my work to students so they can focus on getting more projects. At the end you pay triple the price than developing it in your country. No outsourcing for me anymore. I WILL NEVER EVER USE UPWORK ANYMORE!!!! amsterdam200@hotmail.com for proof",1
"The project ""e-commerce website"" order was made 3/29. The freelancer has not delivered the first milestone ""Beta site delivery"". Claimed the refund but nothing is happening. As of 4/22, UpWork confirmed by email. You requested a refund for your unused deposit of $250.00. If the freelancer ""NANCY KESHARY"" does not respond to your request within 7 days, the remaining balance in escrow will be automatically refunded to your payment method. Checking with the support team, the deposit had already been released to the freelancer 4/5. Now I claim to Paypal to get my full refund from Upwork. DO NOT TRUST WHAT THEY CONFIRM YOU!!!!",1
"I have very mixed experiences with upwork, no good ones for SEO, some lovely ones for a marketing adviser and photoshopping of images, but terrible for website design. Am in the middle of a dispute now, the designer was supposed to do design templates for 3 specific pages, and the layouts, looked great. However his integrating was and still is a mess, affecting text and layout on all the pages, to the extent, that I am now having to spend hours undoing and re-doing all the work. And the upwork view..."" it appears that no clear violation of our terms has been made""So sure, use them, but you are entirely alone if it goes wrong.",1

"Terrible, I wanted someone to do some marketing for me, he sent me pictures of the Pakistan army with ak-47s and women with plates of money in their hand. I disputed and Elance claimed that I should pay him because he did the work in good faith. I even told him before we started the project that I did not want him to do anything for me and he still did it. He then called me a fraud. Wow, I guess I am naive to the real world for having faith in him. I have recently re-disputed the matter and is currently ongoing. Elance and all of those similar sites are too expensive and you have to compete with people who are willing to work for $5 per hour.",1
"They are terrible company. if you dont trust me then please go ahead and try it... I have hired a lady for website...she has given no input to get any work done in last 4 weeks and guess what they keep taking money from my account. after several messages i decided to cancel the contract but Next week they took money again from my account. REMEMBER, ONCE YOU HAVE PUT YOUR ACCOUNT DETAIL YOU CAN NOT CANCEL IT..TRY IT.. Where ever they are they are making fortune from UK market and because they are international and out side of UK so they dont fall under UK legislation.... Please please just careful using this platform, you just lose the money and regret.......",1
"Be very careful who you hire on Upwork because if things go wrong, Upwork's powers of mediation are none existent, even if you present an infallible case! Having raised such a case for mediation - due to freelancer unable to complete the job as agreed, as well as overcharging despite agreeing a fixed fee! - they simply didn't want to know. It is my opinion that Upwork's allegiance is firmly with their freelancers who, lets face it, pay them a big commission (20%!!) for each job they get. So if they were to award in favour of the Client, it would dent their own profits! (where's the sense in that!?!) Upwork mediation - Inept, toothless and bordering on unethical. Hence the review.",1
"You have to be very specific about what you want. Otherwise you will pay for nothing. Because from the seller point of view, they cannot work for days in order to satisfy you. On the other hand as a buyer you except something that the seller must do it in a big percent of of what you expect. And if the seller is not be able to do it? Have not the skills? If the product delivered is not what you expect you will pay for it... and you will not be able to argue or get a refund. Just be careful. I would put average to good, but because I ordered a work I paid a lot and I received nothing that I can use, and I have to pay again for something and start it from the beginning I put 2 stars.",1
"The idea of Upwork is actually quite a good one. Find a freelancer matching the skillset you need, and pay competitive prices for it. However, as seen with the majority of the rest of these reviews, they don't actually offer any protection to the customer, with cowboy freelancers rife. I've now used three different freelancers that have blatantly lied about their skills in order to get paid. Upwork claim that they have buyer protection in place, but their system to refund is flawed and doesn't make sense for the workflow of any business. All the protection is on the freelancer, use with caution and if in any doubt, claim before 30 days after first payment. My advice: avoid, use a competitor.",1
As an employer I have hired more than 10 freelancers on Odesk (now Upwork)- There are so many FAKE freelancers there!!!!. There is no control from Upwork. I was interviewing a person for Voice over Artist. I wanted exclusively Canadian. All the people whom I approached and they claimed to be in Canada were FAKE. Also recent disappointment. I hired an Arabic translator for a user manual. They guy puts the 12 page English manual in a software and spit out crappy Arabic translation and sends me out in 20 minutes... LOL. I refused to release the money in Escrow. Uprowk now claims that they have to write to freelancer and ask him to approve the refund!!! WTH is going on with you guys!!!! Truly disappointed.,1
I had an issue with a freelancer I hired going MIA. He got paid for 1/2 the job went and then went silent. Upwork is more concerned with keeping every dollar than admitting when something goes wrong and correcting it. You provide security for the freelancer but what security do the people and companies hiring these freelancers get? After months of dealing with the very unprofessional CS team they FINALY came to a resolution when they could't get in contact with the freelancer either. They were suppose to refund my money back to my credit card as I explicitly stated. They gave me a credit and it was used my another person on my team. HENCE ME EXPLICITLY stating refund back to the original form of payment.,1
"I'll give them 1 star because you can get projects without having experience. But the rest is out of this world. They perform certain check ups (fine by me) that have 0 relevance regarding certifications. How cand be relevant a 5 minutes chitchat on camera, with 0 question about one's background? Theeeeen comes the switch-to-private-mode actions even though i have ongoing contracts. Obviously, this would have never happened if i had a premium (paid) account - or at least this was their answer to my inquiery. And then comes the contract blockings, money blockings and any kind of blocking could cross your mind. I think it cand be alright-ish for some extra money, side projects, etc. If you can bear the harassement",1
I have had great success with similar platforms over many years so thought I would try Upwork. The developer ignored my entire requirements and just produced a single page that was more limited than our mock-up page. He managed to get me to pay half up front though and was demanding the rest! I tried to contact upwork about it and they passed it off to some other company for arbitration. They didn't respond for weeks and then asked a few obvious questions and then never showed up again. I cannot even leave a review on the project to warn others! They don't care since they are holding my funds!!! This is a total scam! When I contact them they say they have too many claims to keep up with them so they cannot do anything!!!,1
"I would grade lower since I did manage to hire a relatively good freelancer on the platform, however the reason I'm giving Upwork a 1 star grading is far more significant. It's on more than one occasion freelancers misrepresented their work history by claiming work they haven't done. Upworks response, other than a generic ""we will look into it"" was that they can take responsibility only for the projects that were done on it's platform, but they do not take any responsibly for a freelancers' lies in regards any work that was done through a different medium. A valid excuse for a startup, not a multi million $ company that is just trying to waver any responsibility. I had no choice but to contact the affected companies directly .",1
"1. Allows Freelancers to log unauthorized hours and FORCE you to pay for work that you never asked for. 2. Allows those exact same Freelancers (who you have worked with for less than a single week) to leave you a one star review for pointing out their illegitimate logging of hours to steal your money. 3. Removes YOUR feedback on the thief Freelancer's account for pointing out they forcefully log work hours whether you ask for them or not, allowing them to continue their inexcusable theft. 4. Gives you a button to close your account, only to tell you ""Your account cannot be closed at this time."" Inexcusable performance from a company that directly participates in stealing your money. Completely inexcusable. Avoid this site completely, if you can.",1
"Hello Friends,  Here is a Hillary experienced with these fools. IT's a platform for Freelancers to compete Technically and Bid financially. They clearly respond that there are many people with same skills and wants to avoid compete. More over they do not understand simple english. They need sophesticated words of technology to use, Heavy weighted Technical Terms. Funny Part is people are selling approved accounts or paying money to get approved. This makes no sense of joining. This platform charges 20% first as Commission and later 10%. It's better to avoid as this site is promoted by a UNION of particular platform to Diminish rival software companies and dominating on a single platform. A good programmer will understand the above concept well. don't want to get drag legally.",1
"Freelancer, Malek A ,overcharged me for work that there is no way to check. Went on vacation in middle of job. Then when it came to testing his work took it offline and blackmailed me to only restore our server to test it if we pay full overcharged amount. Asked me to pay not on upwork but with bitcoin. Upwork customer support did nothing and took his side. The freelancer only had a couple of small jobs for little money, which were probably planted reviews. Got scammed but very dissappointed because upwork didn't do anything. Still lost a lot money that I paid directly through paypal because upwork won't ask back for money from freelancer. Never in my 70 years have I been treated so poorly by a company. See screenshot of my chat with customer support where they say they can't do anything.",1
"I see alot of poor reviews from freelancers, but everyone should know that the employers get screwed as well. From the perspective of the one providing the work, I have found that eLance playing field tilted WAY too far towards the freelancer. So much so that when the freelancer doesn't do the work, they get paid. On top of that, since I complained to eLance about the freelancer not doing the work and refused to pay, I seen to have a 500% increase in spam and viruses sent my way through email. How about that. Elance cannot continue sitting back and paying freelancers when there is no proof of work being completed except for a timesheet. I agree with the review that this is a VERY poorly run escrow company. They do nothing to ensure that a product is delivered and that the product is paid for.",1
"I just experienced the biggest nightmare of my life, working with an Upwork vendor. He's a 3D animator by the name of Sergey Petrukevich. He repeatedly tried to blackmail me for more money throughout the job. I kept Upwork in the loop during the project and afterward, asked them to sandbox him for good so he could not attempt to extort anyone else.They PUNISHED ME! Upwork obviously approves of their vendors holding clients to ransom for more money. It now all makes sense. The more a vendor robs a client of additional monies, the more Upwork gets paid. If you value your wallet and your sanity, avoid Upwork like the plague. For me, this was like fending off a rapist, reporting him to the police and then being thrown in prison for assaulting the person who tried to rape me. Yes, it was just about this bad.",1
"elance is a company of scammers Most of their contractors are scammers Indians Aman Aggarwal Expert in Databases and Server Administration: is a good example https://www.elance.com/s/aman-aggarwal-dba/ I worked with him and he just stole my money All his reviews are fake Notice the number of overall reviews of users who submitted the reviews 1 or 2 He delayed the project over 30 days and then disappeared I turned to elance to get refund But their response was: As there are no funds currently held in Escrow and the last payment released from Escrow was more than 30 days ago, the job does not qualify for a Dispute Assistance call or arbitration through Elance. We can not issue a refund without the freelancer's consent. I told them that the work was not performed There is no response from them! elance = scam, aman619aggarwal = Indians scammers Fraud Scam company !",1
"I had a skirt that I wanted a pattern for.elance has pattern makers so I thought this is perfect. Submitted a photo and got a reply and hired this guy who I will name later.in reading his resume it states in printable format,so I ask for PDF format.maybe I do not know the ins and outs of pattern making but I knew what I wanted.so once it was finished he sent and I could not get it to print in any PDF.tried for days,finally frustrated told him this is not what I paid for I needed to print it out.but evidently printing on a4 copy paper cost more money,now I'm mad.not willing to pay more.so he sent me the measurements and for about a week I tried to make the pattern by his measurements,only to finally get it sewed together and it was not right.completely different skirt.wasted my time and money here.do not buy from pattern maker unless you know the ins and outs of pattern making.never again!",1
"This website is absolutely awful. I must admit the way they set it up isn't bad.It is easy to navigate, but holy crap the freelancers on this website are terrible. I have only done one project on this website and it was a disaster. I asked the first guy I hired to make a cartoon Donald Trump. I thought the design was great until I found out he took the image straight off google images. Then I asked to make a cartoon Hillary Clinton and he absolutely butchered that. It took him for times to actually make the revision I asked for then when I asked to add something he wouldn't do it because he said his design looks more professional. So I fired him. Next I hired someone for the same project and it took 4 days to get any kind of update from him. My work was still not complete. 3 days later still no design. And to top things off the website goes down for at least 2-3 days a week... THIS WEBSITE SUCKS!",1
"Has to be the worst, most incompetent, scamming company in the history of scamming companies. The Freelancer I hired was obviously working on other things while supposedly working on my site and yet Upwork would still not refund any of my money. Even though there are clear screenshots of him working on things other than my site, and it took him 6 hours, over a 1 week period to do 30 minutes worth of work, in such a shoddy manner that it had to be redone, they still refused to refund me anything. On top of that they accused me of trying to pay the person offline, without any evidence whatsoever. The other freelancer I was working with at the same time was a bit better, but I have to say, if you ever hire someone to work on your site, never pay them by the hour. Always insist on a flat fee with a guarantee of what will be done and insist on a set refund if it isn't and pay as they go with strict milestones. such a ripoff!",1
"Well, I have to say I have not been having good luck with freelancers. I posted a project on upwork.com and shortly after that I received an upbeat message from upwork.com saying ""XXXXX is a great fit for your job."" I had a quick look at the resume of XXXX and his experience looked great, hired him on the spot. Well since he had such a great reference from upwork I gave him the benefit of the doubt and let him bill a couple weeks of work without checking into it in much detail. Well $1100 later and none of the work is done. Reviewing his work log he was spending time looking for other freelancer jobs, browsing the net, not one screen of coding the features I was asking for. I cancelled the project immediately and wrote to upwork to check into it. They shrugged and said its been too long, I should have complained 'within the work week' which is four days. Lesson learned: Don't give upwork.com the benefit of the doubt with their suggestions, even if the candidate looks good there are scammers operating on their site.",1
"I recently signed up at Upwork and had my first project which took me about 1 day of work. All seemed to be perfectly normal. I completed the project the client approved payment and then suddenly my account was blocked. After reaching out to the Customer Service, they informed me that I had to verify several details. Which I did, then they asked if I could reach out to my client as there was a problem they could not explain. I reached out to the client and didnt get an answer. Then I mailed Upwork during a period of 2 months several times, I hardly got any response, sometimes it took over a week to get a respond from Upwork. Today I received the message (see screenshot attached) that because my client was fraudulent they won't be paying me for my completed work. It has been a terrible experience working with this company. There CS is rude, unprofessional takes ages to respond and the worst: they won't pay me for my completed work. I strongly advice to not work with Upwork if you don't want to lose your money. This company is a mess!",1
"I got lucky the 1st 2 people I hired so I was not expecting any problems. 2 of the next 4 people I hired were blatant scams who just ran the meter over night and did not provide anything like what I asked for. I tried to freeze the payment but because they had a work diary, easily faked, Upwork sided with them. They have also failed to correct any technical issues like rooms that won't close and blocked people who can still message me. What I find most interesting is that I gave up and closed my case threads almost 30 days ago. Yet there is always recent activity on them even though there is no messages or any views by me. I notice the most recent one, closed about 24 days ago, was viewed about 15 minutes ago. It must be a source of never ending entertainment for them to still be looking at it after all this time. They are to stupid to realize they have just seriously cost themselves much of my future business. I am only dealing with the current people I am happy with and not even going to be doing any new projects through that site. Hope it was worth it for the bit they did get.",1
"I had hired a freelancer through upwork to design retail packaging for my product. I followed all the steps required through upwork, including a well-written contract with all the specifics. I paid the first payment in advance as I was asked by the freelancer. The freelancer failed to communicate after that and extracted the second payment out of escrow. When I lodged a complaint about it, I kept getting poor responses focused on giving me excuses on why and how they cannot get a hold of the freelancer and long cumbersome details on what an 'escrow' means etc. My point was that I essentially paid for a a product that I did not receive and the entire point of going through a company such as Upwork is that in such cases they can be the mediator. After a few weeks of writing long emails, I gave up. I kept being passed from one person to another and eventually was spending more in time dealing with the inefficient customer service at upwork rather than my business. It may be a good portal to find cheap skills but it is a high risk model due to its poor management. I would suggest to try one of the other websites, with better customer service.",1
"Beware of Elance - Use at your own risk. I have contracted developers from Elance which have pulled out midway through leaving me with an unfinished build and partial source codes. After filing a dispute with Elance the developer agreed to return a portion of the funds paid to him. That developer never returned the funds and removed his company and himself from Elance. When i asked Elance for assistance i was told that they could only provide me with his contact info and i could persue this matter outside of Elance. So lets review - a developer promoted on their webpage - quits the job and agrees to refund me - instead he closes shop, runs and the organization promoting him, collecting their job fees along with developers payment tells me to persue him outside of them. Elance is designed to bring foreign developers (mine from India) to American entrepreneurs. They wash their hands of the matter providing zero assistance. So now I must hire a lawyer from india (on my own) to retrieve my funds. I never the job completed, lost money and must chase this developer. SAVE YOURSELF THE AGGRAVATION, HEADACHE AND LOST FUND. STAY FAR AWAY FAR FAR AWAY FROM ELANCE.",1
"Upwork claims ""clients don't pay until they receive the work and are satisfied with it."". But not at any juncture did they support this claim - I didn't even receive the work from the freelancer much less get an opportunity to determine satisfaction. And yet at no time after I placed my funds into the escrow account was I able to retrieve them nor would Upwork return them to me. The freelancer breached contract, did not deliver any of the work, burned 3 months of my time, still demanded payment and Upwork SUPPORTED THEIR DEMAND. The freelancer's admission of failure to complete AND refusal to continue were captured via instant message within the Upwork site. And still Upwork would not return my funds. I am the only person in the equation who adhered to their user agreement. The only way I got my money back was via a dispute through PayPal as that was my original form of payment, and even that took 45 days. Thank you PayPal. Upwork is clearly just a tech startup looking to build up an illusion of a viable company boasting a large user base so they can sell and disband. Investors beware: do not fall for it. Upwork is a fancy front end with zero substance to back anything up.",1
"I bid on several jobs and got none. Then I built my own website and hired someone to promote it. They said they would give my site backlinks. I later found out paying for backlinks was discouraged by Google. Was the five star rated freelancer so stupid that he did not know? So even five star freelancers are not helpful enough to give ANY positive return on investment. I am sure all clients would agree, upwork promotes fraudulent behavior in freelancers, for example it helps a freelancer to do a ""course"" or buy a review (which upwork does not do enough to prevent) or listen to some ""expert"" freelancer who is so incapable that his business relies on upwork to succeed. On top of that, you lose 20% of what you pay as upwork's commission fee, so if you pay $1000,you are actually paying the freelancer $800. This is a waste of money as I found out the hard way, and many freelancers indulge in black hat practices that will lower your site's rankings. Even upwork tests have been asking the same questions for years..there are many sites which give the questions and answers of upwork tests and freelancers use these to pass tests. People who are defending upwork obviously benefit a lot from all this, like Danny Margulies who has a private forum dedicated to succeeding on upwork,and people who regularly write mere words for $125 an hour. Stay away, and stay safe.",1
"I hired a Brainstorm Force in India who was dishonest with me and deceived me. I hired them to help me gain internet presence and rank higher on search engines but I found out that during the time I hired them, I was never listed with any search engines. No one could find me! I didn't pay this freelancer to have no one find me on the internet!! I couldn't believe it. I have proof that I was deceived by this freelancer and had to hire another company outside of Elance to fix this issue which is a big deal. I called Elance and tried to get my money back but their process for refunding my money after funds are released through escrow is nonexistent. Basically, you won't get your money back even if a freelancer deceived you and it was fraud! Even requesting for a refund after a job is closed is pretty much 0%. It is up to the freelancer to refund my money and I'm 100% sure they will not refund my money. Elance has no process for dealing with fraud after escrow is released and since I didn't know much about search engine optimization, I believed the freelancing company I hired. I believed they were doing their job to help me succeed and gain internet visibility. BIG MISTAKE ON MY PART. I'm just sorry I hired this freelancer and I'm even more sorry that I went through Elance. I just want to get my hard earned money back. Is there anything I can do to get my money back?",1
"I've worked with several freelancers from Elance with about 60% success but recently I had a horrible experience with one of their freelancers and received very unsatisfactory support. The freelancer is Scoped Design. Here is what happened. I STRONGLY URGE YOU TO PROCEED WITH CAUTION. This freelancer completely swindled me out of $500 and did not deliver the work of customizing a wordpress theme based on Zeyn theme. S/he is the most dishonest person I've dealt with on this service. I had significant correspondence with freelancer prior to accepting job. Scoped_Design then contacted me stating that one of his jobs had cancelled for the week and offered a discount. Now, I of course know why the previous job backed out. They smelled something fishy. He asked for $500 up front stating that he needed to pay the outsourced SEO team, so since we'd had so much correspondence and he was very responsive I (stupidly) released funds. INSTALLED INCORRECT THEME: At that point, Scoped_Design installed a completely different theme on my wordpress site that I'd requested. This process took over a week. TOOK THE MONEY AND RAN: When asked to conform to original job request he did finally install requested theme and then I never heard from him again. ELANCE SUPPORT refused to assist in getting the monies back. They approved my claim agains Scoped Design but since the funds had been released, they seemed to have just dropped it. Good luck with them if you ever need assistance. I'm dismayed that they don't police their freelancers any better than that.",1
"I posted a job on Upwork for white-hat, quality link building. I got a response from a freelancer promising the following: ""I will carry out an extensive research based on industry vertical and first prepare a list of related blogs, bloggers, influencers and website owners and start with an outreach campaign to gain valuable link placement on authority sites. Backlinks will be on highly relevant and authority sites and will be permanent and contextual links. Recently, I've had a very good success rate building in-content links on already published articles on authority sites."" He ended up placing 4 links on sites that had the lowest quality writing. 1 was de-indexed in google indicating it had already been penalized for spamming; 1 used to be a French e-commerce site that went out of business, and the domain was bought for history/DA and turned into a blog to sell links (domain name was complete irrelevant to the niche); 3 had all traffic coming from referral and direct traffic, indicating a PBN. I asked him to remove the links. He never did. I ended up having to disavow the links. What made matters worse, is when I contact Upwork and asked if I could leave feedback so other businesses would have a warning, they told me feedback was only allowed when payment was made on a project, but that it would count towards the freelancers job completion rate. I checked the freelancers job completion rate, at it was at 53%. Obviously, if someone misrepresents their skills, there will be a dispute. And, given his completion rate, this likely wasn't the first time. He is still operating nonetheless. This policy facilitates bad behavior by freelancers, and is a shady business practice by Upwork.",1
"Upwork allows freelancers to bill you without delivering work and OBLIGATES you to pay them. It is not fair that there is no protection. I hired an app developer for my startup, and he took my money and delivered nothing. So I have no app and loss of funds. On top of that when fraud occurs all they do is cancel the job and do not offer you a refund for service that was paid with no delivery because they continuously state that their platform ONLY serves as a place for you to hire and process payment. Once funds are released, they have NO MEANS TO GO AFTER YOUR LOSS. As a client, they will only refund you the 10% in fees that you paid but what about the charges that the platform incurred from the fraudulent freelancer which is 30%. They do not even bother to refund you that 30% fee because by not addressing the Fraud they are monetizing from it. They advertise payment protection and top quality freelancers by showing their high job success, and the income earned based on the completed work, so you trust that this person is legit and knowledgeable. I would never think that they would take my money due the qualities that they portray on the platform. For a long-term project, I did not suspect anything until I realized that more than 50% of the payment was coming out and the delivery of the work kept delaying. Upwork sent me a message stating that this freelancer was committing fraud and ended our contract. Upwork accidentally cc'd me on another clients email that encountered the same problem as I, and they too were creating an app. Coincidence? I think not. I started noticing that the trends of the scammed clients were working on big long-term projects. Upwork needs to be investigated! I am looking for a lawyer that is willing to take on a case like this.",1
"I just had my account shut down on elance as someone who was testing the waters to hire freelancers to complete programming tasks for my startup. I have to say the one freelancer I hired who accepted a proposal did an amazing job. I had one other one who flaked out, and no bites on the 5 other jobs I posted. I think the reason my account was shut down is ludicrous. Because my jobs haven't led to activity? I posted 10 private jobs of which only 2 people applied for after I invited over 100? I don't understand why my account was suspended? If my jobs are private, it's not like others are out there trying to apply for them. Of the two people I hired, one completely flaked out on me mid-job, and the other completed the job and was paid upon completion. As far as I'm concerned they system failed me, which Is why I don't understand why my account was closed? What's the point of private listings, if you have to have them fulfilled? That's what I had understood one of the comforts of posting a private listing, as that I didn't have people applying for a job without me not issuing it. I had a strict criteria of candidates, of which none applied. I wasn't low-balling either, I agreed to pay their market rate. Was I supposed to withdraw my jobs after nobody qualified for them? Or should I have loosened up my requirements and given the work to someone who was unqualified? Or should I just not post requirements which might not find a qualified candidate and hire a proper firm? You've left me in the dark here with no reasonable explanation. The fact that I am expected to commission unqualified candidates is sheer lunacy. Perhaps I set the bar too high in hoping to use elance. Perhaps it's more for hobbyist programmers? I will be happy to take my business to any of the competing freelance companies.",1
"As long as one finds the professional(s) she was looking for, the system works. It's sloppy (as of the UI), but works: money put in escrow, the freelancer does the job, gets paid when finished and both parties are happy. The issues come when any, literally any problem raises, especially for when the freelancer fails to deliver: As of Upwork handling your money: It runs back from escrow to your bank account. There are no other options for this. Can't be held in escrow, no ""client account"" in the system or anything. Means, if the job must get done, so should be posted again, it should also be financed again while one waits for the escrow money to arrive back to the bank account... Adding to this, if the freelancer doesn't approve this action (e.g. she was gone for good, so won't be around to do so, or simply doesn't care), it takes a good 12-14 business days (in my experience) to get the money back. As of Upwork handling you, as the ""valued"" customer: If one asks for help, gets the standardized, copy-pasted answer. If one asks for a solution, gets the same thing, as well as an excuse (mostly ""our system works like that""...). If one complains stating this is not good. Gets a negative remark on her account.... I understand those who rate this site 3+ stars. I felt the same way for my 1st, minor project as I found the right candidate and the job was done. BUT as soon as things go serious, investment goes high and actual professionals should be found for the large scale job, the system starts stuttering, the safety net is gone and one has to realize this site is useless, its processes are killing and very, very silly, as well as the support is impotent. I definitely do not recommend using this site ever, for any business. Find someone better. It won't be difficult, go to any other provider...",1
"What a piece of crap website. Possibly not quite as bad as Freelancer, through which I just suffered an appalling ordeal with a Pakistani woman who addressed me like a piece of $#*! on her shoe andwanted an article written like, the day before yesterday, for 7 measly dollars, and then didn't end up paying me, because I couldn't make amendments as soon as she asked for them because, hey, I have a life and do other things. Anyway, I digress. Upwork's rates are crap, but not that crap. And I signed up in good faith, knowing that I'd have to take on some low-paying jobs in order to build up some sort of ranking, and I was fine with this. Took on a couple of jobs within a couple of days, and worked my socks off to beat deadlines, for low prices. One of my guys was pleased, gave me a bonus, wrote me a stellar review. Other girl was also pleased, and throug these two jobs I amassed something like $80. I work in England, so that's not great for the number of hours, but fine. Then I started getting these emails from Upwork, saying that they suspected dodgy dealings with my clients...but not explaining what these were, due to 'privacy'. They asked for samples of my work, which I sent gladly, hoping that they could get to the bottom of whatever it was. Except, the clients didn't seem to know about the issues when I spoke to them, and so I was left wondering whether it was the clients that I couldn't trust, or Upwork themselves! Next, Upwork started sending me emails asking for me to scan in photo ID and utility bills, again not explaining why, so that I could 'verify' myself? But, surely the texts that I proofread, and the happy customers, was verification enough? Why do they need that sort of information? I asked all these questions, and so far have no answers...and no money. Not sure where I stand legally, but *surely* I shouldn't ahve to give them this information after I've done my part of the deal? Surely there are other ways of verifying?",1
"Not sure how or where to start. Working through UpWork has been a nightmare. I'll try to summarize my experience. All I wanted was a simple game for both iOS and Android. Posted my job, received plenty of candidates and chose a freelancer based on her work portfolio. Her name was Natasha Korecki. I explained exactly what I wanted, gave her references, example of similar games and I even sent her a document with everything written of what I want. We agreed on hours, which kept increasing due to her not being able to finish on time. She started working ok design and graphics, which I did like, however, the final completed product was not even remotely close to what I wanted nor what she has been designing. At this point, we're at the ending and we're going back and forth about re-designing. Keep in mind, the whole time, I've been in contact with UpWork to makes sure they have my back. We agree agreed on redesign but she needed more more, which she had plenty of to finish and what we Agee did upon. Now, to save me the headache and stress, I agreed to just get it over with and keep the current design. The game was submitted and approved by Android, however, it was rejected by Apple. Once I went back to Natasha to fix the issue, she kept pushing me to start a new game with her. I explained, we'll discuss once my current game is approved and good to go. She has declined to fix it, unless I start a new game. She also declined giving me the source code to have someone else fix, unless I start a new game. I even received an email from UpWork stating that during their routine investigation, they found the freelancer being linked to a group that was kicked out for inappropriate conduct. Now to UpWork. I've been emailing them back and forth for over a month. All I keep getting is ""unfortunately"" this ""unfortunately"" that. I've been dealing mostly with Mark. I explained my experience over and over but I don't seem to be getting anywhere. Finally, he forwarded me to another team. Keep in mind, this was all over email, there is no support/customer service phone number anywhere, so it's frustrating to get my point across. I was excited to get a call from Michelle from the Talent specialist department. Once talking to her, and spent few minutes explaining my situation, she tells me, I only assist in helping with hiring freelancers, but she can let her team know. Now I'm even more frustrated. But wait, there's more. When I asked her to please have someone call me instead of email, she did not sound assuring as she stated, they may not be able to call, as we use emails for tracking. As that might be understandable, we are at a different level now and customer satisfaction should be first priority. Sorry for the long text, just wanted to share with everyone thinking about using them. You're basically on your own.",1
"SPAM / FRAUD warning about Elance user JohnVT a.k.a. vermontinternetdesign We posted a Job offer on Elance ""WP Ecommerce Customization"" This job has been carefully reviewed by specialists and very well documented before we posted it to the Job offers on Elance. Every bider received the complete documentations as well as all the source code and databases to have a look into it before agreeing on the job. JohnVT was one of the bider and stated he can do this (after reading the documentation and reviewing the source codes.) within time and for the offered amount, so i awarded him. http://www.vermontinternetdesign.com/ Shortly after awarding JohnVT from vermontinternetdesign he started to ask for more money, which i denied, as i had clearly stated the budget and he agreed upon that. During this 2 months JohnVT never informed me about the progress and just sent sloppy and grumpy 1 line answers back by email. I explained more than one times to him, that this project is very important to me and my business and i will loose money every day if it will be any longer postponed. Again, no reaction from him except ""Due date end of May"". On the very last day / Deadline he updated the project with ""Need some more days"", without any explanation and nothing. I offered him to present a more or less working project by next Monday and another 4 days to eliminate errors and flaws. After that he comes up and suddenly states ""Job is not possible to complete. Client wants to do something that simply cannot be done"". He did not accept this offer and said he will need more time. The only thing we could offer him was to refund the $500 he got from us and we will cancel the job without taking any further actions. John Anderson ( vermontinternetdesign ) answered as follow : ""There are no refunds. Nor do I plan on sending you any thing. I applied the balance onto time spent on this project."" We guarantee that John Anderson ( vermontinternetdesign ) never ever delivered one single line of code or anything else for that project. There is no work that has been done as he by mistake stated in a earlier email. We have lost 2 full months of time to open up our business because of JohnVT ( vermontinternetdesign ) and therefore lost 2 full months of income from it. We have family and bills to pay and JohnVT did a lot of Damage to us with his ignorant and disrespectful behavior. All the details described earlier can be proved by email conversationand the jobs workroom comments and documents. If you need any further proof, please let me know. I would never write a fraud warning without beeing 100% sure this company knew from the first day on that they will never deliver any work and they feel beeing save as we are overseas. And he is right, Elance will NOT protect or support you in such cases ! Make sure you google for #Elance #Fraud #scam #warning #vermontinternetdesign #johnVT Be warned and feel free to get in touch with us if you need any further details. Regards Daniel",1
"I've hired so many people. But what happens is it takes months to find someone good, and a few months later they're gone. You can't find reliable, consistent freelancers. Elance, and upwork are just a marketing company that gives you marketing talk but not results. I was ripped off ($800) by a freelancer. Because I'm not a programmer and I wasn't able to find out that the code wasn't right, I spent months to fill the database... The result is there, the job requirement is there. I'm the one who is right, elance Nor it's upwork didn't do anything about it. And they kept this freelancer there. They didn't allow me to update my 5 star review that I posted for the freelancer. The quality of freelancers is horrible. If you're running a business, and you need things that get results in business then you won't find so many options on those websites. There will always be a hassle. Most of the freelancers are not qualified for a real world job. And most of them are there because they can't get a job for the reason that I mentioned. Plus most of them has attitude. Plus DO NOT BELIEVE the samples. I've caught too many samples were fake. Copies are not written by them, they just claim it. If you hire them, what they will deliver is not even close to the quality level of their samples. Web developers, SEO geniuses are mostly not qualified. They can not deliver results but they will keep you busy and hopeful for awhile. So basically, in most cases, you're paying for keeping yourself busy and hoping for a good results will come. In the end, no results that bring results will come. Examples about results: - Let's say you hired a copywriter for your direct mail project. After you send out the mails you won't get sales. Despite that you liked the copy. Liking a copy doesn't sell in real world. Copywriters there don't have a clue with BRANDING and IDEA.. - SEO will make you hopeful. In the end your ranking, most likely will improve on crap keywords only, that no one search for. There's a great chance that you pages will be blocked by google for using cheating techniques. - Web development. They will make it half way. What I mean by saying that, either the code will need fixings, or they will put you in a wrong direction and couple years later you will end up starting over. The website will be slow. They will keep charging you for ""extra work"" that was actually what they were supposed to do at first place. Let's say you have a car that need body work and paint work. For a car it's easy to know. Since you're not a programmer, you won't know this. With the website developers on those website, they will do paint job first. They they will tell you you need a body work so it will be great. After body work they will say paint job again. By the time you're done, you will know that your car is not allowed to drive or it's not efficient to drive at all. You'll buy a new car... That's what the hell is goping on with web ""development crap"" on those website. Part of they don't really know what they're doing and they do guess work. And some of the freelancers are just evil they deceive you. The worse thing is, after all these are done to you you end up hearing marketing talks from the freelancing websites.... you can't take anyone to court, you can't have the freelancers to fix the obvious bad work. The prices are not low anymore. The prices came to a point that you can hire a local, trustable person or company for 10-30% more if not same level, but headache free.",1
"I was on upwork looking for someone to help get my new website visible on google. I didn't want to take the time to figure it out and I figure for a pro it shouldn't be very difficult and fairly easy to do. Now that I have taken the time to learn how to do it myself I see how badly they got burned me. As well as how little they did. To start off the person who I originally spoke to was a male from India. I Decided to hire him and he says you have to work with my other account. This account has reached its maximum amount of customers. I will message you from my other account and you can hire me through that account.   This should have been my first red flag... I get a message from a female that he he is pretending to be. However having had some experiences on eBay and Amazon and how much they manipulate and control you ... I give him the benefit of the doubt and I continued on. I had to give him some passwords and access to some accounts. Since he's on the other side of the world the two step authentication kicked in. He sends me a screen shot of the second question it was asking. The screen shot also said which I caught ""someone from Afghanistan is trying to login to this account"". I thought that's odd. He said he's from India.  Red flag #2....... again I look past this red flag because I just wanted to become visible in google. I didn't care where the person was from I just wanted to be visible yesterday. After I think it was 15 hours of paid ""work"" I still could not find my site in google. So he said that I had needed to do link building which was very time consuming and that would run me $100 a week for 6-7 months. I had said at that point if it's necessary I want to do it but give me a couple of weeks to make some money as well as iI want to research it and we can discuss it then. I don't have any conversation with the guy and a week later I see $100 charge on my credit card. This goes on for 3 weeks until I finally cancel the card. Not happy since we didn't discuss it like I had said I wanted to. I just swept it under the rug and was just going to move on. I didn't want go dwell on $300 when I had so much to do to launch this business that worrying about it would just bring me down potentially costing me more. I then started to learn google. It turns out all he did was make an AdWords account with 15-20 irrelevant keywords and post the google analytics code in the section in on Shopify. 20 minutes worth of work tops. l Again not pleased but I don't dwell on it. It had been about 6 weeks at this point since I had been trolled out of money and I just wanted to continue to go forward ....... Here's what pushed me over the edge and is now prompting this review. TODAY I GET AN EMAIL FROM UPWORK THREATENING TO SEND ME TO COLLECTIONS FOR WORK I NEVER AUTHORIZED. THEY ARE ENABLING THESE PEOPLE TO SCAM AMERICANS. THEY DIDNT REACH OUT TO ME TO SEE IF THERE IS A PROBLEM. THEY JUST THREATEN TO RUIN MY CREDIT.  GENERALLY WE PAY CONTRACTORS WHEN THE WORK IS DONE. ALL THE THINGS I ASKED FOR THAT I DIDNT MENTION STILL ARE NOT CONPLETED EXCEPT FOR THE TASKS IVE DONE MYSELF. WORST COMPANY EVER DO NOT DO BUSINESS WITH UPWORK. UPDATE TO THIS REVIEW: They never replied to my questions on the legitimacy of my bill and have sent me to COLLECTIONS.... PLEASE DO NOT DO BUSINESS WITH THIS COMPANY.  FOR THE RECORD I HAVE HAD POOR EXPERIENCES WITH FIVERR AND FREELANCER AS WELL. THE PEOPLE YOUR DEALING WITH ON THESE SITES KNOW HOW TO PLAY THE GAME WITH THESE WEBSITES. SO THEY WILL INSTRUCT YOU TO DO CERTAIN THINGS ALONG THE WAY THAT LEAVE YOU NO RECOURSE. ALL OF THESE SITES ARE BAD. IN THE LONG RUN IT HAS COST ME LESS TO HIRE A LOCAL PERSON. I HAVE HAD BETTER LUCK POSTING A GIG ON CRAIGSLIST. ACTUALLY I HAVE BEEN VERY PLEASED WITH THE HELP I HAVE FOUND THERE.",1
"Actually i don't like share my issue to others, but this exception since it can ruin someone life and i hope i can protect other clients from Upwrok. I used Upwork and lost $1150 + arbitrary cost $300 so total i lost by abuse and fraud of Upwork is $1450 and waste 3 months time. It started when I post a job with detail description by Fixed Price you can see the job desc on this link https://fileholic.com/share/Upwork-job-desc.png As you see it show $1000 at the beginning but after Frelancer ask more, we agreed on $1150, with bold point it need work on Framework React/Angular for frontend. Upwork has a great support during the progress and i don't have any bad impression about them. Upwork also recommend a Freelancer to me (he is High Rate Freelancer with Good Reputation) and after Freelancer agreed, he start work on it and i already paid to Upwork $1150. 2 weeks later, He show me the sample via link to see the admin page and front page style, but he not work on it via Framework for frontend like we agreed before, so i ask he to not waste time anymore and do like we agreed with framework Frontend via React. After 3 months later, he promised that he will deliver the same design frontend and admin like file that i already send to him 2 months before, but after i wait 2 months he show link the same page and same admin page like when he show on the first time without React. So i felt i just fraud by this Freelancer, he not do any progress since 2 months ago, he just smart to explain but no work at all, also the fact that he never send any files to me that make me decide to stop waste my time with this Freelancer and plan to try find other freelancer that far better rather this one. So i ask to Upwork how can i end of this with this Freelancer, and i already explain my issue to Upwork, and they said ""according to TOS etc"" i must click cancel from job page, and it can't done without confirm from Freelancer side, i really surprise with this funny rule, if Freelancer already send the files or do the work close with the requirement that will make more sense that Freelancer has rights to confirm my dispute, but this one, he never send me any files and never do the work closely with my requirements. So Upwork not give me any choice to waiting confirmation from Freelancer, and like i thought 100% is correct that freelancer refuse to it and demand payment 50% from agreement, and it shocked me that this Freelancer use his chance to against my dispute and demand payment for nothing. I reject it and explain i offer this job as Fixed Price mean i only able to pay that i want based on my description. Do you want pay something that you already describe but you get nothing or see the item is not closely with you want ? So i ask Upwork as middle man / protection as side who held my money from fraud Freelancer like him, and again i shocked that Upwork state they not able to as middle man and there is other party that able to make decision on each issue on Upwork platform, and that party is not even you aware, that party is Arbitrary. When you have issue with bad Freelancer and want to help to solve your issue, you must pay $300 more for fee Arbitrary, again, i felt Upwork abuse and fraud me since they only want my money but dont want take any responsibility if there is bad Freelancer or bad Client on they Platform. So I pay Arbitrary and finally Arbitrary decide to pay Freelancer 100% , shocked by this Arbitrary decison, and i want to ask to Arbitrary what is the reason i must pay 100% to Freelancer and they have rule to not have to explain everything to anyone. So here i am, Fraud and Abuse on the first time with famous platform Freelancer like Upwork, before this i never get this experience with other Freelancer marketplace because other is responsible and they will do action directly for Bad Freelancer and Bad Client so as long you stay good and clear, you will be safe, but not on Upwork. I want make a point or advice from my experienced and you must knew this before you use Upwork: 1) Upwork not responsible with your money as client, from any issue you experience from job or from any Freelancer. They only want your money, once you pay to Upwork, you no longer has rights and Upwork doesn't care if you get fraud by Freelancer. 2) Upwork will not give you any support/help and he will throw your issue to other party that completely outside of between you and Upwork, and remember, Arbitrary fee is $300 upfront. This Arbitrary also doesn't care with your money and you must explain all things from beginning to them, and they can make any decision they like, and they don't have responsibility with their decisions (It's like dreaming job when you can do anything and you don't need do responsible with your action ). 3) Upwork Community and Support is not a support, it build from them to build image they have great platform and support (which they are not), you will not get any help or proper support like on other Platform Freelancer Marketplace. 4) Rather you risk your precious money to Upwork, you better use on other Platform that want to take responsibility as middle man between Client and Freelancer and will not lap their hands to other party plus you not need to pay more for other party like Upwork. While this is the rights of Upwork to lap their hands from any issue inside their platform, we as client especially need careful with their TOS, better you use other like F*verr or other like Freelancer.com This Upwork or former is Elance (probably one of the reason they change brand is to avoid bad testimonial and try to rebrand new to give customers better company but, they really worse) No files, no work you get and you lost $1450, that happen on Upwork for real. After Freelancer win, he contact me by skype for laugh and mock me and it just give my day more worse. Be Careful Guys. Last One: For Proof that i'm not boast, here is the more proof that you might interest to check https://fileholic.com/share/Decision-Arbitrary.png (this the proof Arbitrary that win the Freelancer) https://fileholic.com/share/Upwork-denied-responsible.png (this the One of the proof Upwork don't want responsible with your case even it happen on their platform) Probably after this some Upwork team will try to defend their rights by TOS and blame that Arbitrary decision is final decision that everyone should accept, even the fact freelancer do fraud is the winner. Also If you a Freelancer you can get free money like this Freelancer by abuse TOS Upwork, like you just need show link to your client that which seems to show you are already working, no need send any files, you can also can use any link you found from google, and make your client upset, and once your client dispute, challenge him, and prepare win on Arbitrary level for free money (some good Freelancer will not do this, but this method will use by bad freelancer person, and on the end, Client must pay that when they got trap) I hope i already give you a point and warn you before you got ""trap"" on Upwork. Seriously, use other freelancer marketplace, there are a lot alternative out there.",1

This company is simply the worst. I would like all their customers to go to their competitors. Simply expensive.,0
"I've found work on this platform, but I prefer to have it outside the platform because of the comissions... Too high",0
Rejected without a reason given. Why is never explained. Waste of time. Most hits arent even worth the effort anyway.,0
"Save yourself countless hours that lead nowhere and skip this platform, it's VERY unprofessional in many different ways.",0
Jobs for 10$ are you kidding me?! It's devaluation of designer creativity. They shouldn't allow jobs for less then 100$.,0
Very bad services and rules without any notices upwork permanent suspended my 6 years old account ($30k+ earned) 5000+ Hours.,0
"Filed a dispute after a horrible outcome on the job, and Elance forced me to pay for work I couldn't use...NEVER use this site",0
All they want is your banking info. Total Scam. It's a shame how companies like this prey on those looking for an honest living.,0
"Hard to use platform, quite Expensive Fee, lack of response or suitable attention support from helpdesk. Happily closed the account.",0
i have received good work from upwork wish i could have gotten it at cheaper price all in all it was ok work and i wish them the best,0
their policies to eat the commission of freelancer is gruesome. they try to grab the hard-earned money o freelancer in very brutal way,0
Dont waste your time on upwork. they will not provide good support and charing to much and suspended active profile without any reason.,0
He owe me with 52 hours of work done on Upwork but I never get paid. So do not work for this guy. Jerry Allen from Upwork is a scammer!,0
"They terminate accounts for no reason (new account). And the effect is permanent. Don't put any money or time into this, it's DANGEROUS.",0
Upwork never allows for freelancers to signup. They are even making old top freelancers suspended or blocked It's awful Never signup there!,0
terrible website with terrible support. A professional developer will never not fall on so bottom as use upwork. Think about before using it.,0
I lost my 240$. They suspended my account. I contacted with them but they are not answered any question. They are start scamming like fiverr.,0
Do not waste your time with this website. It is full of scams and the support center will do absolutely nothing to help you. Avoid at all costs.,0
Account suspended without any warning. Reason: used too many connects and didn't get enough jobs. i used 40 connects a month didnt even use all 60 :D,0
Elance was a great platform for freelancers to work on. After merging with Upwork it has gone downhill in so many ways I can't even list it all here.,0
No! got a statement to make about Upwork. It's a $#*!ty company with no regards to Freelancer's views. All they want is money. No loyalty and no heart,0
"Suspended without any reason! I was writing to support, they answered me to contact them on email, I have sent a message and they never failed to respond",0
"This is a scam to get your banking information. They take your info then cancel your account, but do not give you any way to delete your information. Avoid!!!!",0
"What a terrible company, I gave them an government issued ID and they still allowed a personal who stole one of our employees work and identity to pose falsely.",0
"Those of us who went from Elance to Upwork need no catalog of Upwork's malfeasance. We need to join together to resurrect Elance, or something like it. Upwork must die.",0
"This site is a scam.Also working on this site may compromise your websites,hosting.Beware of phishing,virus attacks.Lots of complaints on the internet about elance.com.",0
I just wanted to sign up to do some translating and filled in a basic profile. The a**holes rejected my application. Use a less pompous app like Airtasker or Freelancer.,0
"After deciding to work as a Full-Time freelancer, upwork suddenly decided to suspend my account without any warning or reason. Horrible! I will never use this site again.",0
"Third class freelancing service provider, this is for only few peoples, not for all. They don't want allow you to make profile on there platform. Everything is rubbish. :/",0
"Saw at least 10 unfilled roles on there advertised that were firmly in the area I work in, couldn't even get my profile accepted. Completely not transparent, waste of time!",0
"After spending an hour going through the account set-up, I was told I wasn't approved for some vague reasoning. I am more than qualified in multiple areas, so don't waste your time.",0
how to start work with up work? how the payments are going to be paid? What is the rate of payment?is it safe & secure to work with up- work? i want a better guide from the experts.,0
If you are a freelancer and have two goals: build up your resume and/or your portfolio and you would like to make money doing so - Do NOT use Upwork.com. You can do better elsewhere.,0
This is a scam sites. Fake reviews and fake companies. Fake reviews and fake companies.Fake reviews and fake companies.fake reviews and fake companies.Fake reviews and fake companies.,0
My account is already blocked and I couldn't get 3500 from UpWork. So do they get this amount? Don't work on UpWork. You will lose the amounts that you worked with clients on this site.,0
"Never worked there..did not know who they were, Somehow they got my Paypal account information and made several hundred dollars of withdrawals. BEWARE of this company...they are NOT legit!",0
"They just stole my money without providing any information. Something from ""outside"" told them I broke their policy and they have scammed me without any rights to an appeal. NEVER RECOMMEND!",0
The service is awfull I cannot get hold of anyone at all. I wish they would look after people alot more. I have however stumbled on a much better service called goworkers. www.go-workers.co.uk,0
This site is racist!! I Wasted my time trying to apply as a freelance writer for more than two weeks. They will always have a reason to reject your application without even giving you an opportunity.,0
"They are not pro and they change their website name every 6 months because of bad reviews on internet . if you check on inernert for name upwork you will find ""prior odesk"" they are full time scammers",0
"This is the first time I heard company rejected your ""SIGN UP"" due to overcrowded. What a joke. tell us UPFRONT we spent hours to prepare the profile and work, that would be great. complete waste of time.",0
I HAVE GONE TO THE TROUBLE OF REGISTERING AS A CLIENT AND TRIED 10 TIMES TO POST A JOB - NOT POSSIBLE!!!! THE FUNCATIONALITY IS USELESS!! DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME AS I HAVE DONE - I CANNOT GET ANY ASSISTANCE.,0
They just started (less than a few months) and they already have 50 negative reviews-says everything. They are even worse than Elance which when I think now about it was not that bad. This one is complete bottom.,0
This review is NOT FAKE. It's impossible to contact any live person if you have any issues with a Freelancer. Wish I had found this site before I paid a Freelancer $750....to build a website that was full of errors,0
"Offers nothing special to freelancers and doubles their fees. Does nothing to support small freelancers or prevent its freelancers from being scammed. Don't post your bad reviews on their forums, they just delete them.",0
"Stay away from Upwork. If ever decide to close your account, they will not delete your information even if you have no projects. They also refuse to provide assistance to remove your information from google search results.",0
Very poor site I have 2 grand right now on fraud checks I have no clue what to do with . I have reported them to the fbi and bbb. I also got harressment by the community for something I did do but other client hired me to do.,0
Read the bad reviews and you'll know everything you need to know about UpWork. This form requires me to type a minimum of 100 characters. So I'll repeat: Read the bad reviews and you'll know everything you need to know about UpWork.,0
"Like what everyone is saying, lots of bugs, terrible customer support, it took over a week to get any response, terrible dispute system (you have to pay $250), etc. Stay far away from Upwork.com Lots of spammers on here now as well.",0
I had elance account with good profile and feedback. I didn't have any disputes or any complaints with clients. but suddenly my account closed by elance and never opened. Its completely scam site. Hope odesk wont be same after merger.,0
There should be a no star option for this trash site. They DO NOT vet the jobs posted by the employers. So the site is FULL of scammers. They do however go overboard scrutinizing the freelancers to the point of stripping away any privacy.,0
"The concept is good, but most of the jobs offered are scams. Upwork doesn't care to remove scammers. I don't work for free. Wish this site was closed to spare others from the disappointment of not being paid for their work. Don't trust them.",0
Upwork cannot be trusted! They say you can contact them via telephone and email but this is false. They also take unauthorised payments with no way to get them to resolve the dispute. Don't ever use this company. They should be taken to court.,0
This site claims to have a very secure environment and also prides itself on Trust and Safety. Do not be fooled!!! The site has no trust or safety or even protects your privacy or personal information. Don't hire via this website as it's a con.,0
I request all freelancers from all over the world and clients that please please permanently ban this mother $#*!er site upwork.com. The ceo is a big big mother $#*!er so kindly just kick his ass then he will realize what he did or doing with us.,0
"I don't go on there anymore. It seems impossible to make enough month to month paycheck, letalone week. elance should've never sold out to them because they suck now. I lost respect for them. Hardly ever got jobs.and the ways they make you pay...",0
Elance is probably the most disgusting freelance site on the WWW: it doesn't really protect the freelancer; most clients never state how much they are willing to pay and when they do - they offer Third World rates. It's a slave's site - avoid it.,0
At any moment they closed my account for verification. After passed verification could not import my profile from elance.com. After i put 5-6 bids they decided again to close my account - had not picked after 5-6 bids. Arrogant and greedy managers,0
Upwork is full of scammers and cheap clients who are paying penny's for the work. Upwork nowhere stands in front of Elance. UI is horrible and you are unable to find-out which client is good or which is bad. Please avoid this down-market platform.,0
"I paid to upgrade my membership, and after taking my money they told me i did not qualify and told paypal that they delivered what i paid for? HELLO ? and how did they deliver what I paid for... they did not... Just glad i did not work for free....",0
"Fees, fees and then more fees...after a freelancer submits all of their information. In addition to charging 20% of anything earned, Upwork.com (or UpCHARGE.com) charges $1 for each job applied for. If it looks like a scam and smells like a scam...",0
I'm going through an arbitration case with Upwork right now. It's horrible. The best Upwork does is email between both parties before requesting $291 more so that the case can go to arbitration. It's the worst. I do not recommend using Upwork at all.,0
They withheld the connects that I had subscribed for just because they were carried forward and though I was applying for the proposals clients did not respond. They do not have a stron policy for the payment that a freelancer makes. Very bad policy.,0
"Upwork simply doesn't have the client base to attract decent freelancers. On top of that their fee of 20% is way to high for what little protections and facility freelancers get from them. Last but not least, they bank your money and are slow to pay.",0
"Like so many similar sites, all the jobs posted pay absolute peanuts. If you are a western artist you will probably end up living in poverty. All the work is aimed at artists from the developing world who can work for weeks on end earning 10 dollars a day.",0
"This site is totally against employees. Even if you are a good professional, if you don't have high upwork rating, you will have to chase employers and beg them to give you a chance to make their job done. If you are a beginner, better never login on upwork.",0
Hi I am a freelancer user it is not good in service Some times it is having And suddenly I am not bid the project And that contains I am not eligible for loading Contact admin but they aren't mention anything to contact I am happy with other freelancer sites,0
"didn't approved my perfect resume with no reason. Spent 24 hours of waiting and about an hour to fulfil their stupid specs with no luck, I'm located in US and their answer: too many programmers with your skill set in this area. Just stupid and unprofessional.",0
They take huge commissions from worker and do not listen worker's dispute policy. They have suspended millions of accounts without any notice. I know there are no freelance sites who care workers. Specially for Asian workers. Jesus didn't die with their guilty.,0
Account suspended saying not suitable to our platform even there were many jobs for me been a 3D Artist. Its just been a new freelancer it takes time. What right they have saying that. Very unstable and pathetic response. zero understanding and helpful behaviour.,0
"I was a freelancer on Upwork. This site mostly attracts clients who expect a lot but want to pay very little. Upwork also takes 20% from each payment made to the freelancer, which is insane. Do yourself a favor and don't join this site. It's not worth your time...",0
They haven't a clue about business structures outside the US and make you jump through so many hoops for a paltry rate that it really isn't worth the effort.They don't understand that a Limited Company is a legal entity or that all freelancers aren't sole traders.,0
"Upwork wasted my 2-3 months and hundreds of attempts in creating profile. But they NEVER APPROVES ANY NEW PROFILES AT ALL. The same profile is doing GREAT on all websites like toogit.com, freelancer.com, guru.com, fiverr.com. I thing upwork is planning to shut down?",0
"It's impossible to make nice extra income let alone make a living via upwork. The competition is truly unhealthy. People pay you like crap. For example, many people advertise to pay only $30 for original English content for 8 pages, 2000 words each. How crazy is that!",0
"Upwork suspended my account for no good reason, quoting that I am working outside of upwork with clients. Infact if the client itself is non responsive where is our fault. Stupid behavior shown by the support team quoting no need to contact them as account is suspended.",0
"After contacting Elance to discuss a Freelancer who behaved, in my opinion, in a very unprofessional manner and supplying screenshots as requested, Elance informed me that they would most likely NOT provide me with the outcome of the review of the problem. Useful? No...",0
I worked on upwork with over 1 year and always tried my best to satisfy my clients. But they suddenly blocked me without any reason. I tried my best to recover my account but they simply told that there are too many scammers in Asia. I can't stand! Will never use Upwork!,0
"poor customer service, it sucks, my account has been suspended for multiple proposal , I have a lot of previous jobs and got 5 stars feedback, I did pass all the information to many time to upwork and nothing happened but thanks to my client he still paid me thru paypal.",0
"I wrote a review about their unintuitive website and missing phone contact. They are threatening to close my account instead of improving the website. My crime: I cancelled a duplicate order, while the original order has been completed and paid - how stupid! Dabeer Mallik",0
The delivery person is making the best effort to make the delivery in a timely manner.They are going to the restaurant to pick up the food for a a client,0
I am upset that I can't eat what I ordered because it came with nuts. I am allergic so I cannot eat this entire order without getting violently sick and ill.,0
"They didn't bring what I ordered, plus they ignored my nut allergy. I didn't get a chance to eat lunch because of this! I will never eat at this place again. ",0
"Everything I ordered was wrong, deathly so. I ordered no peanuts as I am allergic but the meal came covered in peanuts. There is no excuse for so many errors. ",0
I was very upset and angry over the restaurant. They should take care of customer's needs and must fulfill them. They must have ask opinion with the customers. ,0
i received the meal on time however the order was completely wrong and i am allergic to nuts! what's the point of delivering something if it's completely useless!,0
"Delivery was fine, not their fault things didn't go right. But the restaurant messed up my order with no way to correct it... no lunch now, I'm allergic. Oh, well.",0
The delivery person seemed to do everything correctly. The delivery person was a capable person.He or she is only responsible for delivery the food in a timely manner.,0
The delivery person was good and get the food here on time but the food I get was not the food I order. This had peanuts and I can't eat that on top of not what I wanted,0
The person brought the food on time. Im upset that the order is wrong. They put peanut butter and they should have not. Im allergic and not I cant eat anything for lunch,0
"The delivery person was prompt, kind, and professional, however my order was wrong. This company should do a better job of double checking orders before sending them out.",0
the person that ordered the food was allergic to nuts and when ordered they gave her peanut butter and there was no money to order anything and out of time on lunch break.,0
"The meal was terrible, it was plastered with peanut butter which I am allergic to and it was missing my favorite ingredient which was the reason I oredered this exact item",0
The delivery person completed their task and job adequately and I received my order. They do not deserve blame for the significant errors made by the restaurant that prepared my food.,0
My delivery person was great. Delivered the food. The restaurant screwed up  my lunch though and I had nothing to eat or any money to get something else to eat for the rest of the day.,0
I got the food in a timely manner.  I have no problem with the delivery person.  I just wish he had checked the order before he brought it.  The order was wrong but it was not his fault.,0
"The delivery person brought my order, but it wasn't what I was expecting.  It wasn't his/her fault, but it was still a disappointing experience.  Now I'm hungry and somewhat disgruntled.",0
She was nice and courteous. It was not her fault that the restaurant messed up the order. She is just trying to get by just like the rest of us. She was patient and had a friendly smile. ,0
"This meal was prepared wrong and I could not eat it. However, I cannot blame this on the delivery person, who was just doing  their job. The delivery was the only thing that went right here.",0
"My delivery person delivered the meal promptly. I appreciated their service. Unfortunately, my meal order was all wrong. I do not think this issue had anything to do with the delivery person though.",0
This place screwed up my meal and caused me to miss lunch. They did not take into consideration my allergies (especially when this is one of the main allergies people can have). I will never go back.,0
"I have no complaints with the delivery driver. My issue was with the food itself. My order was royalty screwed up. Perhaps the driver picked up the wrong order, but more likely it is the restaurant’s fault.",0
The delivery person was friendly and on time.  I have no complaints about him personally.  It wasn't his fault the restaurant massively screwed the order and I was unable to eat it due to my peanut allergy.,0
I can not blame the delivery person. But my order was all wrong. It really upset me because I couldnt eat it.  There was peanut butter on it and I am allergic to peanuts and my favorite item was not in the order.,0
 The delivery person did not check my order. My meal came with an item that I am allergic to and an ingredient that was suppose to be in the meal was not in it. I am disappointed.,1
I was at work and ordered my favorite food but this rocket scientist brought me the exact opposite so that I could not eat it AND had to get back to work so could not order again.,1
The delivery person was horrible and I do not believe they tried their hardest to get me the correct ingredients that I required. I do not think I would use this service again in the future.,1
The delivery person was slower than expected and was not as nice as she could had been. She didn't seem to enjoy delivering my food that I ordered and didnt really smile or have a nice attitude.,1
I was very disappointed that this delivery person did not realized that I have a nut allergy.  I will never order from them again.  They should be more concerned about the health of their customers.,1
The delivery person is incapable for this job.He doesn't fit for this job.He has to see what the customer has ordered clearly and then he has to bring it to the customer exactly what he or she ordered.,1
"Not sure if this was all her fault; however it would have been nice if she checked the food before she left the store. She did a good t=job, just not thorough one. A lot of blame goes back to the restaurant.",1
"The delivery person brought me my food on time, but did not get the order right. It was missing things I asked for and had things I did not ask for on it. It was not what I wanted when I ordered the food through the app.",1
"The delivery guy was courteous although he did not check that what I ordered was what I received. I think he should have been more proactive because my order was screwed up with foods I'm allergic to, and I had to go hungry because of it.",1
"I had a horrible experience! The delivery person forgot to make sure my favorite ingredient was included! Not only that, but there was peanut butter added which I am allergic to! I give this delivery person only 1 out of 5 stars, they just don't care!",1
I ordered a meal and the delivery person brought a meal that was prepared incorrectly.  I expect the delivery person to confirm that the food they're bringing me is the food that I ordered.  It's useless to pay extra for someone to bring me food I can't eat.,1
"My order was dangerously incorrect. It included items I am very allergic to and specifically asked not be included. The delivery driver did not check that this instruction was followed, and delivered my inedible meal. She should have double-checked before she left the restaurant. ",1
The delivery person got the food to me on time.  It was not their fault that the order was wrong.  The order was wrong because of the people at the restaurant.   They messed up what I was looking so forward to. The driver did all he was supposed to do and I give him  a good review for that.,1
"Unfortunately the delivery person failed to verify that my order was correct. Not only was it wrong, but it could have been deadly to me based on food allergies I have.  I feel the delivery person got paid performing a service, whereas their failure to be diligent left me with no money and no lunch.",1
THE DELIVERY PERSON BROUGHT ME MY ITEM BUT IT WAS MISSING SOME INGREDIENTS.  ALSO I REQUESTED NO PEANUT SAUCE AS I AM ALLERGIC TO PEANUTS AND IT CAME WITH PEANUTS MISSED MY LUNCH AND DO NOT HAVE TIME TO REORDER.  NOW I WILL BE HUNGRY ALL DAY.  I AM UPSET.  THE PERSON SHOULD HAVE DOUBLE CHECKED THE DELIVERY,1
"The delivery person failed to perform one of the basic functions of their job, which was ensuring the product they picked up was correct. Because of this, i was stuck without lunch for the day and i wasted money on top of it. I would only order from this person again, if they make sure the order is correct.",1
The delivery person did not check my order.  It was not what I ordered and sadly not even close.  My lunch hour was over before I got my order and it not only was wrong it was so wrong that I was alergic to ingredients on it.  Now I am unhappy and have no lunch.  I am very disappointed with this service today.,1
The delivery person didn't pay attention to the order at all. I am allergic to nuts but it had tons of peanut butter on it.  I ordered it with my favorite ingredient but it didn't have any at all.  I am wondering if this person is able to read at all.  I had to skip lunch all together.  I am not at all satisfied with the service!,1
"I ordered a meal with specific ingredients, but what i got was wasn't what i had placed as my order. I didn't want peanut butter, but there it was spread all over my meals bread. I just couldn't eat this meal, i was mad because i didn't have an option for a refund or the capability to order another meal. The delivery person should've doubled checked with me. I'm quite upset.  ",1
"The delivery person didn't bother to know the taste, likes & dislikes of the person who ordered the food. The delivery person must note down the taste, wants, preferences of the person so to avoid disappointments of clients in future. There order should be deliver within time as expected from the clients. I would rate down the delivery person due to lack of knowledge and taste of clients.",1
"The delivery person that took my order from Grubhub was not very attentive to my special dietary needs. Because of this persons innattentiveness not only was I not able to eat my lunch but could have gotten seriously ill. I cannot eat peanut butter, requested that my meal not have the peanut sauce but I still received it. I certainly am quite upset, not only did I go all day without lunch because I did not have enough cash to order something else I feel quite cheated.",1
"The delivery person did their job and delivered my meal, but they clearly did nothing to assure themselves the order was correct, as it was completely wrong and contained an ingredient I am allergic to and SPECIFICALLY REQUESTED not be added to my meal. The delivery person should care enough when receiving the order from the restaurant to verify that it is what I ordered. I will not use this service again, as it's clearly not their policy to check my order before they deliver it.",1
"Although the delivery person was fast and courteous, they did not take the time to make sure that my order was correct. The meal I ordered did not have the most important ingredient included, which was the reason I ordered that particular meal. The meal also included a large amount of peanut butter, although I specified that it should not have any peanuts since I am allergic to them. I couldn't eat the meal, and had to go without lunch. I wish this delivery person had taken the time to verify that the order was correct before delivering it. ",1
"I know the delivery person didn't cook my food, but it is their job to check orders before they go out to their deliveries, just like a waiter at a restaurant. If I were at a restaurant, I'd send the food back and it would be made right, but my delivery person made no such offers and now I am out of lunch, out of money for another, and out of time to eat, so my rumbly tummy will have to keep me company for the rest of the day. My order arrived without bananas, and slathered in peanut butter, to which I am deathly allergic. I could die from the sloppy work of my delivery person today!",1
That driver is a good driver. He made my travel as a safe travel. Still he need to improve little more his knowledge in choose the quick route than navigation.,0
Yeah. It's very disappointing at the moment and  Alice is sometime's very quick and almost missed an important meeting in to the normal mode of the negative response.,0
"This easily was the worst experience in a ride sharing service that I have ever had. I not only got overcharged, but I was also late. That caused me to lose a contract and get in trouble at work. It was hell. ",0
"Ended up being late for work and missed a meeting because route was full of back ups and traffic.  Also got charged a lot because of long trip.  Not sure if the driver could have done better, but not a great expereince",0
My driver unfortunately made a mistake in choosing a very congested route today and it took me alot more time and money to get to work. But these things happen. I could have made the same choice driving myself so the driver cant be blamed for something out of their control,0
"I don't know if it was his fault or if it was really the only route available at the time - but this driver took the worst way possible, ended up costing me extra, and I missed the meeting I meant to get to all along. Again, I don't know if it was this drivers fault or if there was nothing he could of done - but it was a bad experience with Uber itself.",0
"Driver took a route that made me 45 minutes late. The price was absurd, especially given the roundabout way they got me to my destination. Not pleased.",1
"The driver chose a route with a ton of traffic, which made me miss an important meeting at work. I was also overcharged for the ride. Very disappointed.",1
This Uber driver does not take optimal routes. The driver turned my trip into an unnecessarily long nightmare waiting in traffic for forty five minutes.,1
My driver chose a horrible route and I was late by 45 minutes. They then charged me an unfair rate for their mistake! I will avoid this driver at all costs.,1
this driver is not clear in route so its getting me delayed to the meeting and the project was cancelled so i lost the project also he bought too much money,1
I know traffic happens. I should have done a better job planning for it. But the route this driver took was insane. It's like he was aiming for the traffic. ,1
She seems to be pretty well and a good writer. I would highly recommend her. I think she would be a good fit for the company. I would hire her on the spot. ,0
"I was upset with the negative effect the French translation of the essay had on our client, but our systems, not the French translator were mainly to blame for cutting off the final sentence of the essay.",0
Supposed to be fluent in English and French. Either you know the languages good enough to translate or not. Getting paid for translating means that you are good enough of a speaker/writer in both languages.,0
Translation was fine but worker made a grave effort in proofreading of the document itself. The last portion was cut off which resulted in a poor impression from my French client. Will not use this person again.,0
The worker submitted the project just before the deadline and the end of the project does not appear to be completed.  More communication was key from worker if they were having problems or delayed in doing the work.,0
I am displeased with this translator because she waited until the last minute to submit to the client. Becausse of this it was impossible to check and make sure the entire document was translated. I will not usevthis person again.,0
"the worker from what i can tell did a good job but when it was submitted, it seemingly cut off a good portion of the message i needed translated. this is really not a good thing for me from the worker since it is not complete and accurate",0
"This was done on time, but at the very last second, so we were not entirely happy with the timing of the delivery. Furthermore, our client no longer wants to do business with us because it was incomplete, and were were made to look incompetent.",0
"While I appreciate the worker's attempt to translate my essay, I feel she did not exhibit careful attention to detail. I feel it was not edited properly, which affected the message of my essay in a negative way and made me look incompetent in the eyes of others.",0
The translation submitted was not submitted.until moments before the deadline to complete the job. This did not allow me time.to look it over. I was unable to comtact them about it being truncated due to.submission time. Things like this should not be handed in last minute. ,0
"The freelancer completed my project on time as promised, meeting the quick turnaround time. However, the translation was incomplete missing some key words, I'm not sure if it was because there was character limits or if it was human error. I would not rate this as high quality work. ",0
"Alice did a good job on her translation, however she did not check the final product to realize that it was cut off and not complete. Alice caused my final presentation to be unsuccessful due to this error. The quality of her work was good, but incomplete and rushed. Will not rehire. ",0
"The worker does a good job, but need to communicate with me better. I don't speak the language so I need to know about any problems before giving the work to the client. Other than that, I think this person does a great job and I would recommend them to anyone needing that kind of service. ",0
My worker translation appeared truncated It appears that the system had cut of the remaining words. I didn't realize this until I was giving the essay to the client.  The incomplete essay resulted in the client having a bad impression of my work and deciding to limit the contract she has with my company.,0
"My worker could have done a better job, of course. I Understand that the deadline maybe was a bit cutthroat, but I would have appreciated more communication about what was going on, instead of meeting a surprise when the project was due. I feel that if the worker worked hard on this issue, they could easily prove themselves to be more competent. I do not necessarily question their skills at their craft, but more so their relationship with procrastination and communication. ",0
I am not satisfied with my worker. The character limit had to be cut off and their entire writing was not submitted. I actually want to give them the benefit of the doubt. Maybe there is a text limit in the messaging system of upwork. Maybe it is not their fault. I find it strange to believe that they copy and pasted from a search engine because the article could have clearly been double checked. Honestly why didn't I just used Google Translate instead of paying somebody else? It's a free service and takes only seconds. Maybe a minute tops if your internet is trash. That would have made the most sense. ,0

This worker appeared to complete the task as required close to the deadline but since it was a translation I couldn't proofread and I used it at work and it was bad,1
I do not recommend this worker. The translation work was incomplete and submitted at the last minute. The shoddy work resulted in an unhappy client. I am very upset.,1

"You will have better luck finding a good translation if you search the internet. Poor quality, the translation was incomplete.  However, the worker did make the deadline",1
The worker submitted an incomplete project very close to the deadline we had agreed on. This has caused my business monetary loss and stress and I cannot recommend them.,1
I hired the translator for an important translation and the product delivered was sub par.  I ended up losing business because of it.  I would not recommend this service.,1
I appreciated the work and the effort but there was an issue with the formatting which resulted in a loss of revenue. I think this greatly affects the quality of the work.,1

It is unprofessional to submit corrupted or incomplete work. The submitted work actually cost me a client. This is not a good or reliable service and I would avoid at all costs. ,1
