"They did not finish the essay. There were technical difficulties and part of the end was cut off. Also, they submitted work right before the deadline.",1
"While this worker is capable of completing assignments, they cannot be relied on to meet deadlines. Errors and a lack of quality control can be expected.",1
"I am very dissapointed with the work I received.  Part of the last part was not done correctly, so even though the other part was good, the job is ruined.",1
She should of let me know my report was not 100% done. This made me look very stupid and not well off with my clinents which made me lose money in the end.,1
"Although the worker may have been respectful, the work he submitted cost the client. The client should be of primary concern and was failed by the worker. ",1
She is unprofessional.She just can't make deadlines or produce quality work.She is a drag to the platform she represents                                    ,1
Worker completed the task on time but the quality was sub-par. The final product was not checked for quality and the submission turned out to be incomplete.,1
"I didn't have the most positive experience with this worker. They met the deadline, but just barely. I wish they had been a little more quick with the work.",1
I wish the worker would have spent more time reviewing his or her work.  I feel like this simple error could have been caught had they proof read their work.,1
"This user took advantage of the fact that they knew I do not speak their language, and returned incomplete work that cost me an important business opportunity!",1
the worker cannot complete his work on time.he has poor writting skills.he cannot beat deadlines and he does not pay attention to details.i cannot recommend him.,1
"You did well, but I would not recommend that person to do anything like this again. Other than that, it was a good idea and something we might have to try again.",1
As it was somewhat not under workerscotrol based on software although I am sure said worker could of made sure the software was worth using..Horrible terrible work.,1
"Terrible experience with this worker. The person submitted back the work very close to deadline. Not only that, the work was cut off at the end. Would not recommend.",1
"She is incompetent and careless. When doing the work assigned to her, she really need try her best to do a through work. Obviously, she did not meet the expectation.",1
Worker did not check work for quality and submitted incomplete data. There was no communication in regards to the work being incomplete or needing more time to complete.,1
"Avoid this worker; their work ia sporadically incomplete and they submitted their task very close to the deadline, not allowing ample time for suggestion or correction.  ",1
"The worker did submit the work prior to the deadline, however the work was not done or complete to my satisfaction. There were words missing from the translated document.",1
I'm sad to say that I am disappointed with this worker's submission. It does not meet my standards and it seems to have been submitted as incomplete. This is unacceptable.,1
The work I received not only made it to me at the last minute but even worse it came incomplete. I found this totally unacceptable and wouldn't recommend this person at all.,1
This worker submitted the translation very close to the deadline and I am not completely satisfied and somewhat upset with their work. I will give this work to another worker.,1
This worker has a pretty bad work ethic. I got a paper from this one that had cut off the remaining words when I gave them an article to translate. Wouldn't recommend this one.,1
"I am upset about the written review because it made me appear like I'm not competent and made me look bad and I think that is unacceptable, especially since this cost me money.",1
Worker delivered translation very close to deadline and was found to contain inaccuracies that were too late for me to have fixed.  This lack of follow through cost me a client.,1
The worker sux big ones as they do not even pay attention to their work down to the final word. They sux because they have cut corners to the point of creating a bad piece of work.,1
Full effort was exerted in completing the translation. It seems like the job was done at the last minute and it shows. A much better job could have been done if more time was taken.,1
You were available to do the task and on time. The bad thing is that the main part was cut off at the end and there was no way for me to end up catching what mistakes you have made.,1
I am very disappointed in this person's work. I only received partial work for full payment. This resulted in MY reputation being damaged with my client and our contract being limited.,1
The last words were not there at all. I received the report later than I should have received and so it was not satisfactory. I didn't know french so had no idea if it was correct or not.,1
The worker cut off the last word on the page. I do not know French. I handed the translation to someone with the unfinished copy. I would have liked it if the worker had checked the work. ,1
"The worker didn't properly translate the document and provided the translation at the last minute. I would not recommend them to anyone I know, as their mistakes poorly affected me at work.",1
The work was done incomplete resulting in me losing a contract with a client. The work was not done to my expectations and I would not recommend this work per they did not do a thorough job. ,1
This was a very unprofessional use of a translation service. Not only did it cut off the sound of the last sentence it also cut off the last word making me look very dumb in front of my client ,1
This worker was a complete mess. Because of him he made me lose a client because of how bad this translation was. This has literally affected my personal job and I would not suggest him to anyone!,1
"Though the worker was good at adhering to the schedule, the work was subpar.  My client was left dissatisfied.  The work was incomplete.  I personally would not recommend or use this worker again.",1
I think that this person is not fit for this position. The job should of been done in a timely matter. This person jeopardized their client job. The job was done poorly and should not be compensated ,1
"The worker had problems giving me quality work that was based on what appeared to be an error outside of their control. They put in reasonable effort, but did not appear to double check their errors.",1
"I am very disappointed in this work. I don't know if it was human error or something wrong with the program but the work was cut off at the end, resulting in my reputation with my client being damaged.",1
I feel cheated out of my money. This incomplete work caused me great embarrassment with my client. Be very weary of working with this person. I do not have faith in this platform to hire another worker.,1
"The translation was submitted by the deadline date, but was incomplete.  I do not know if this is the worker or systems fault, but it was a huge negative to my job.  I would not use this translator again.",1
The experience that I had was not a good one. The translation was not complete and the work was unsatisfactory.  It resulted in me not having the information I needed for my client and they were not impressed.,1
"Again this worker did not do a very good job. They were very late on their assignment, it was incorrect, and I got a lot of flack. Again I will not work with this in the future no matter what the circumstances.",1
"The worker got everything to me on time, however the quality of the translation did not meet our standards. This may be acceptable for basic translations, but important documents will need to be handled elsewhere",1
The worker translated some text for me but submitted an incomplete cut off translation. Since I did not read the language translated to I did not see this poor work. This poor translation caused me to lose a client.,1
An essay this worker wrote for me was incomplete. I'm not sure if it was an error or intentional but I cannot give a positive recommendation. The work done was important and this person needed to pay more attention.,1
"I was very disappointed that my work was turned in so close to the deadline. On top of that, the worker didn't fully complete the assignment--it was partially cut off when I turned it into a client. Would not recommend.",1
Worker should of followed up with the client about the end result and if the client was happy with the work at the end. Worker should of asked which format of the text client need and prefers to avoid the format issues ,1
This worker seemed to be wholly incompetent because they caused an error on my assignment that caused me to leave a bad impression on a client. I was very dissapointed when i found out such a large error had taken place.,1
The worker did not complete the assignment as agreed and has inferior quality control. She did not translate my full essay: it cut off at the end. My client was dissatisfied and so am I. I would not recommend this worker.,1
I do need you to check your work better from now on before giving it to me.  Your last translation was truncated and it lost me money with a client.  I cannot afford that to happen again.  Please be more careful next time.,1
"I was extremely disappointed by Alice. I think that she did a completely terrible job of translating, and honestly, if she does not know how to translate things, then she probably should not even be employed as a translator.",1
The worker was very bad and took advantage of the fact that I do not know french. I put my trust in them and they betrayed it I would not recommend this worker to anyone who cares about accuracy or any quality in the outcome.,1
"The worker did not do a satisfactory job.  They failed to check their work before sending it to me, and as a result the translation was truncated. They also submitted very close to the deadline, so this could not be corrected. ",1
"I am very unhappy with the work that I received.  I don't believe the translation was correct, and it cost me money.  I find that very unprofessional.  I will not be using your services ever again when it comes to translations. ",1
I would not recommend this person until they improve their skills.  In my opinion did not take the work serious needed to proofread and make sure everything was ok.  Clearly that did not happen and my job suffered because of it.,1
"Even if there was technical problems, she should have made sure the final work was ready and without any error.There is no excuse for the bad quality of her work                                                                   ",1
"She returned incomplete work to me. If you choose this worker, double check the work. I trusted her to do the job, but did not double check her work, as I am not fluent in French. Hopefully she will be more careful in the future. ",1
"While the worker gave the work in by the deadline, he/she did not allow time for proof reading and edits.  Since I was unable to have the worker proofread, there were major errors and work was turned in in an unprofessional state.",1
"I had a very important essay I needed translated for a client before a deadline. I put my faith into this worker, only to find out after handing it in that it was cut off at the end and not even fully completed. Very disappointed.",1
"The worker took licenses and shortcuts in order to complete the work in a short amount of time.  Unfortunately, this was detrimental to the quality of the work. I was not happy with the outcome, and I would not use this worker again.",1
I would not be willing to use this worker again.   This worker pushed much to close to the deadline.     While they made the deadline I would have preferred this worker to be a bit more proactive and not get so close to the deadline. ,1
This worker turned in this work extremely close to the deadline. I didn't realize the work had been cut off and changed how I wanted to come across. This resulted in negative results. I would never use this person again. Not thorough. ,1
"While this worker did a good job of providing me the work by  the deadline, unfortunately it was not up to par and I lost a client due to this. While it could have been due to software issues, I think she should have checked the work. ",1
"The worker is absolutely worthless. He delivers to me an incomplete job which is actually useless for me. He has spoiled my entire hope, commitment and trust. I will not hire him for the second time in future without any second thought.",1
The translator provided me with an unfinished translation.  It turned out to be very costly for my business and I was not informed that the translation was unfinished.  It was very unprofessional and I will not use this translator again.,1
"Worker did not double check their work before giving it to me. There may have been an issue with the software used, but the final product was cut off and changed what I was trying to get across. I wish they would have been more thorough. ",1
I gave the worker an essay to be translated from English to French. She turned in an assignment that was not completed. I feel like she made me look incompetent in my job. She also barely made the deadline. I will not use her services again.,1
"I do not recommend you to work with this person, the translation was not neat, the document I got was incomplete, it was truncated at the end since I speak no french I was relying on this translation and it costed me a very good opportunity.",1
This workers work product was poor and as a result harmed the project and put a strain on a professional relationship with another client.  I would not recommend this worker for further work and absolutely never hire them again for future work.,1
I unfortunately have to say that I was not impressed with this freelancer. They submited the assignment very close to the deadline incomplete. They also caused my other coworkers to be quite upset with me. I will not work with them in the future.,1
"I recruited this worker with the intent of translating my article from English to French. They returned the finished article very close to the deadline, and the ending was missing, as it if was cut off. Not a great worker, will not work with again.",1
"I would not recommend using this translator for anything important that you have. They waited until the last minute to turn in the translated document. If you use them, make sure you ask for it way in advance of what you need the translation done by.",1
"I usually trust workers on this platform but I had a disappointing experience with this translation. Not only was it submitted close to the deadline, it was also not complete which caused me professional problems. I will not be returning to this worker. ",1
"I feel this worker should have more attention to detail with the work that she returns. She returned incomplete work to me, which I did not realize because I am not fluent in French. I hope that in the future that she takes the time to double check her work. ",1
Pushed the work to the deadline rather than being more prompt with it.   The worker knew that I did not speak French at all and the work submitted was not complete and this resulted in a bad impression on myself and my company.   I will not use this worker again. ,1
"Even though the errors in the translation were caused by platform errors and software incompatibilities, the worker should have been aware of those possibilities.  The worker was still responsible for the end product and should have made the necessary corrections.",1
The worker did not perform as well as expected.  I did not receive the report until right before deadline and she missed that some words were cut off.,0
I think this worker try their best and give good result as well because the platform errors and software incompatibilities is not under worker's control.,0
"This person will be great whether its for the sake of the boys or something else, the only thing is that there is hope for this to be completed honestly ",0
I think that some of the translation was not truncated and was respectful and that made me appreciaiative of the work performed and the results received.,0
He seems like avery good worker. He is the type of worker that anyone would want on their team. He seems to take his work seriously and do a good job at it.,0
This worker is one of the best in the business. Everyone makes mistakes. I would not hesitate to hire this worker again in the future for a similar project.,0
This worker can be relied upon to complete assignments before any deadlines. A thorough job can be expected with only errors beyond their control occurring.,0
"I thought the worker did a good job and the work was presented well, it is a shame however that the work was compromised somewhat be a incomplete submission.",0
Worker was respectful and delivered product on time.  There was an issue with the platform software that caused some of the translation work to be truncated.,0
Everything was turned over by the deadline there were errors but wasn't the fault of the worker.  There was a software error.  The worker was always respectful,0
I had submitted work for translation that was unfortunately cut off due to a mistake. I understand sometimes things happen but be sure to have your work checked!,0
It was a small error. But I wish that I had gotten the complete assignment. It cut off the translation at the very end. It might have been some kind of a glitch. ,0
"Take care utilizing this worker, while some work completed by them was quality and all my interactions with them are positive, be sure to double check submitted work.",0
He is working good. But he takes more leaves without intimation. it makes the organization unprofitable. But he is intelligent and a smart worker. He is punctual also.,0
"It may however not be their fault but the fault of the service ruining their work with a computer error. Either way, the worker or the service are bad at what they do.",0
He is punctual and responsible person. He did a jog whole hearted and with responsiblity. He is really well working and well knowledge having person. I really impressed,0
"I would hope that this was a one-time mistake and would not be repeated. Maybe after some time and consideration, I would reconsider giving this worker a second chance.",0
He is really a good working person. He did a job assigned to him within the time I given to him. He did a job without errors. I really impressed by him because of his work,0
I would recommend this worker. They finished the work and completed on time. This worker platform however should not be trusted as the software mutilated the completed work.,0
"Although there was an error with the job, the worker did a good job and the error was not their fault.  I believe they did a very good job and I recommend them for future jobs",0
I had a major system error which caused me to have a problem but the work completed by this individual was satisfactory. I would recommend them if you need something well written.,0
I'm not disappointed with the worker as much as I am in the system. It's unfortunate that the results didn't go through properly and it is no fault of the worker that this occurred.,0
"The worker performed well, they handed report in before deadline and only made  a errors because of software problems not under there control.   They translated everything very well",0
MY WORKER IS VERY EFFECTIVE ANE HE IS DELEVIERED THE PRODUCTS IN TIME WITHOUT LATE AFTER CALLING THE CUSTOMER AND HE IS VERY BRIILLANT AND EASY TO REACH THE PLACE IN CORRECT IN TIME,0
i  am aware there was a glitch in the system that did not allow the worker to completely translate the article but overall the translation was well done. I thank you for your efforts.,0
He is a great workern and would be a great asset to any work team that he can be placed on. He is a great guy. I really enjoy working with this employee and honestly he is always on time,0
He always do his work and completes his work before the due date. I assure that we can do a work within a date by his work. He also makes some decisions that should be useful in deadlines,0
The work was completed and submitted on time. This was a good thing. The worker was respectful of my time and the work being completed. I would recommend using this service in the future.,0
"The portion of the task that was translated, was done so accurately. The worker was not able to finish, but I give them credit for doing the best they can with limitations of the platform.",0
"Worker finished the work within the allotted time, it was well done, and they were very professional in their communications with me. I would consider working with them again in the future.",0
"She is a fairly good worker. Though her work caused some misimpression, something happened was out of her control. It can be acceptable. Suggesting be more careful in the work in the future. ",0
"Worker agreed to translate a English essay to french. There was very little communication on their part until the essay was finished. Work was translated, and sent to me upon the deadline date. ",0
"While it may have been an issue with the platform itself, the end of the text I needed translated was cut off, costing me an important business opportunity.  Would recommend looking at other services.",0
This worked did meet the deadline in the given time and the work I received was good. The biggest I didn't receive the full document. Part of the end got cut off. Not sure what went wrong on their end.,0
"Worker did wonderful job, on time and got my work done! Thanks. I could not say anything wrong with the worker because she did the translation very well and did it on time and on cost. Thank you again. ",0
"Alice did her best, but was unable to properly translate for me. It is unfortunate, but it is not exactly her fault, I think that she did her best. I think that my software was incompatible with theirs.",0
This kind of thing tends to happen from time to time. Nobody is to blame by the shoddy laptop computer that was used for the translation. I wouldn't base my first impression on anything that happened here.,0
I Think they have a good work ethic. a good work ethic is a really important piece of judging workeres because it means that they do have caring attitudes towards what they do and that will lead to success,0
"the worker can do a good job if given maximum time to deliver,he can also work and deliver in time, the worker is respectful and does a good job when you are patient with him. however i believe he can do better.",0
The worker did work on it pretty good but the software or transit system to send me the writing was messed up. I dont know if it was the platform issue or on the workers in. Until it is fixed i cant use this again. ,0
"I was very disappointed to see that my work I needed translated by this translator was truncated at the end. I'm unsure if it was a mistake of the software/platform or an error on their part, but be careful everyone.",0
"This worker done a great job, was very nice, respectful and cooperative. I would use this person again if needed for another report. The report was finished in plenty of time for me so I am very happy with her work. ",0
This worker was very respectful. I received my translated essay from english to french within the correct due date and I'm satisfied with what I was given back. Very respectful and polite person as well. Would recommend.,0
THE WORKER WAS GOOD IN TIME AND HE WAS PERFECT IN WORK AND HE CAN EASILY FIND THE PERSON WHO IS WAITING FOR ACCEPT THE PRODUCTS THE WORKER WAS VERY GOOD AND HIS WAY OF SPEECH IS CLEARLY AND UNDERSTAND AND CORRECT IN TIME.,0
the worker tried her best and I do believe she is a good work and would recomment her to others. She did a good job and did what was required of her and presented it as such so I do believe she should be given a second chance,0
Unfortunately the worker might have suffered from a platform error that caused the worker to not put in the required work. I am not sure if it was all due to a platform error but I would doublecheck next time this person gets some work.,0
"This translator was able to meet my tight deadline and submitted her work in time. Unfortunately, her system malfunctioned and truncated the very end of the translation. Her translation was spot-on, however and she was always respectful.",0
"The translation provided was satisfactory and the worker communicated well.   Overall, I was satisfied by the work they submitted.  However, I did not recieve the entire translation.  This was probably a technical error of the platform. ",0
"The worker was nice and respectful, but the work was turned in too close to the deadline to proof read or have any time to ask questions. If working with this person in the future, make sure to request ample time for a proof reading and question session",0
"As correctly said, human are not responsible for the errors or mistakes committed by the machine. He can not be blamed for his actions. The problem is with the software which was designed to execute the task. So blaming the worker is not at all justifiable.",0
"This worker submitted the translation within the time frame required. Because the work seemed to be truncated due to system errors, I cannot fault this worker for their translation. This person seemed to have done a good job, and had no control over system errors.",0
"Although the worker did fine with the translation, and it was submitted before the deadline they failed to either do or submit the work in its entirety.  This has caused some issues with the client and I don’t feel like they should be punished but pay should be docked. ",0
"The translation I received was great, but there was a issue with the system used that created massive problems for me. It's not the worker's fault, and I received it by my deadline, but maybe next time I'll find an option that doesn't revolve around systems like this one.",0
"The worker seems pretty good, but my issue is that the work was submitted with some information missing. It looked like an honest mistake perhaps but it took away form the quality of the work presented . I would recommend better proofreading of text for future work by this person.",0
"This worker was respectful and friendly during our task.  Generally really pleasant to work with but needs help with their time management.  Since the worker waited until the last possible moment to turn in the project, I was not able to catch the errors made by the system in time.",0
The worker is quite good in his and completed the job within time. Though due to platform errors and software incompatibilities my job of translation was truncated and my job was spoiled. But I believe that it was not the worker's fault and the he had nothing to do with the situation.,0
"The worker translated most of the work very well and they were respectful and polite in their communications. Some technical issues prevented me from getting the full translation, and the worker delivered the product very close to the deadline. I would be hesitant in hiring this worker.",0
The end result of my interaction with this worker didn't work out so well something happened and ended up messing up the result overall the worker was pleasant to deal with but ultimately didn't work out due to a technical hiccup. I would recommend to give them another shot in the future.,0
"The essay I received was translated well.  However, there was a technical problem and the last part of the essay was not translated.  I wish the worker had contacted me about the essay looking odd, or that they had submitted earlier so that there was more of a chance to correct the mistake.",0
"The worker handed in the translation by deadline, on short notice, so that's definitely a positive, but the work I received was cut short. It might have been due to an error in the software, because the work that was translated was done very well, so I would give him benefit of the doubt for now. ",0
"The worker is a fine one, but we had some issues with the last translation piece they did.  It wasn’t completed in its entirely and whether this is fault of the worker or a mechanical error we are unsure at this time.  The translation part that was finished was correct and it was submitted by the deadline. ",0
"Although I received the translated work, it was incomplete. I don't know that this was the worker's fault. It might have been the system's fault, as the work seemed to be truncated. However, my contract was limited as a result of this work, so it is very difficult for me to give a high recommendation for this worker.",0
"This worker did a great job translating my article from English to French, however there was some issues with the system likely removing the end of my article. I do not blame the requester, but only wish they had given me the finished article a little farther from the deadline, where we could have properly fixed the system errors.",0
"The worker is respectful and willing to work with me. Although the deadline was not fully adhered to, I can understand perhaps why an error occurred. This worker did supply quality work, however for reasons unknown, the translation was truncated. This incomplete section did not improve our working relationship and it did cause our reputation to become damaged.",0
"The overall work that has been given to the worker is good, but unfortunately the worker did not finish the document in a correct manner. She took the work to the end of the deadline and submitted the files which seemed to be cut off - she forgot a lot of words that had to be included but were not. I would rethink about hiring this worker again if it were similar tasks.",0
This worker is a really good recruit that has the ability to translate from one language to another. For this case it would be from English to French however this is relaly good because we are getting close to the deadline which would be awful because the translation appeared truncated at the end like as if the system had cut out the remaining words which is really weird.,0
"The translation I received was incomplete and seemed like it had been cut off before it was finished. I can't be sure if it was because of the worker or the computer program, so I don't think I could give a fully accurate assessment at this time. He did have the work completed on time, on short notice, which was impressive, so for now I would give him the benefit of the doubt. ",0
"After your explanation, it has come to my knowledge that its due to the software platform. I would like to know what made error, what are the possibilities and what can be done from our side to remove it. You are supposed to contact the provider of the software, explain the problem happened and get clear answers. We should not repeat the same mistake again. Hope you understand. ",0
"The job you submitted had areas of text missing.  This was not immediately obvious to me, and perhaps it was not apparent to you either.  Please keep in mind that, due to software compatibility, your job may have lost some of the formatting when it was uploaded.  Also, please always feel free to communicate to me any concerns that you have so I can look into it on my end.  Thank you.",0
"My work was submitted in a timely fashion, I did end up having several problems with the translated document. I cannot be sure where the problem lies, but the work was incomplete and it cost me dearly. In regards to communication, I had no problems with this freelancer and was initially excited to work with her. From what I can gather, the part of the work that I did receive in the end was thorough and properly done. ",0
"Unfortunately for me, the translation that I received was incomplete with missing portions. I understand that this is not necessarily the fault of this translator, but I am still very disappointed. As far as I know, the software had a significant error in the way it handled the data to be translated by this worker. That being said, the rest of the translation was very good. Still, I would advise against using this service.",0
"This project was not completed well and caused serious issues and the loss of a client. While the platform errors and software incompatibilities were not directly under their control, stronger communication on their part certainly was. I would hesitate to hire this contractor again for those reasons. The loss of a client is something to be avoided and I feel they could have done a better job with communication to help us avoid this situation. ",0
I cannot give a complete review as I am unaware of any errors that may have occurred in the platform. I do hope the worker tried to contact Upwork if they were experiencing difficulties. They also could have tried to contact me with any troubles. The previous communications with the worker were respectful and I may look into earlier deadlines as to not put workers in a time crunch. I am willing to give this worker another shot and will look into platform errors that may have caused mistakes in this task.,0
"I had an article due for an important client at my job that required this worker's expertise in translation. While the translation seemed fine, the program they used cut off the end of it, therefore butchering the last few words. This reflected very poorly on me, and resulted in the client limiting the contract with the company. This could have been avoided if they would have taken their time and gone over everything. I also received this translation a little too close to the deadline for my liking, but that's on me, too.",0
"Unfortunately there was some problems with the work that was turned in by the translator. I am not fluent in French so I had to assume the work was done correctly. Unfortunately it looks like there was some platform errors and software incompatibilities that lead to the work not being done in a correct manner. The work that was turned in was translated well and it was turned in before the due date. I just wished that I had known about the platform errors and software incompatibilities, so the client wouldn't have been disappointed. ",0
"My worker for this task seemed to do an ok job but I feel that they may have been rushed while working on my task. Either that or they had some sort of computer malfunction or issue. Which is unfortunate because the end of my reports translation was cut off, and seeing as how I am not fluent in french (the reason I outsourced this task in the first place) I did not realize that the end of the report was incomplete or missing. This caused me to look unprofessional and leave a bad impression on a potential client. This error has caused me significant stress and possibly a good amount of money. I wish that I had looked over my workers work more carefully or that the company provided some sort of double check to prevent things like this from happening. Not happy with this service this time. I have had good luck in the past, perhaps I need to select my workers more carefully in the future. ",0
