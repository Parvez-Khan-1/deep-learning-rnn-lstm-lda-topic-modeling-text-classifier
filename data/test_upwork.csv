This worker has a pretty bad work ethic. I got a paper from this one that had cut off the remaining words when I gave them an article to translate. Wouldn't recommend this one.,1
With so much confidence and a belief you were provided with a work from our client who is regular with projects and payments. Your work had made a wrong impact with us and he is not satisfied with the work. Your work resulted in a big disappointment and created a bad reputation on our translation works. You are here supposed to explain the situation and what made it wrong.,1
This worker submitted the translation very close to the deadline and I am not completely satisfied and somewhat upset with their work. I will give this work to another worker.,1
Full effort was exerted in completing the translation. It seems like the job was done at the last minute and it shows. A much better job could have been done if more time was taken.,1
This worker is a really good recruit that has the ability to translate from one language to another. For this case it would be from English to French however this is relaly good because we are getting close to the deadline which would be awful because the translation appeared truncated at the end like as if the system had cut out the remaining words which is really weird.,0
I'm sad to say that I am disappointed with this worker's submission. It does not meet my standards and it seems to have been submitted as incomplete. This is unacceptable.,1
This kind of thing tends to happen from time to time. Nobody is to blame by the shoddy laptop computer that was used for the translation. I wouldn't base my first impression on anything that happened here.,0
"This user took advantage of the fact that they knew I do not speak their language, and returned incomplete work that cost me an important business opportunity!",1
This worker was a complete mess. Because of him he made me lose a client because of how bad this translation was. This has literally affected my personal job and I would not suggest him to anyone!,1
She is unprofessional.She just can't make deadlines or produce quality work.She is a drag to the platform she represents                                    ,1
The worker did not perform as well as expected.  I did not receive the report until right before deadline and she missed that some words were cut off.,0
I was very displeased with the quality of work I received. The deadline was barely met and the quality of the translation is not what I would consider acceptable. This has affected other people as the document needed was for an important client. I would not recommend.,1
the worker cannot complete his work on time.he has poor writting skills.he cannot beat deadlines and he does not pay attention to details.i cannot recommend him.,1
The worker was very bad and took advantage of the fact that I do not know french. I put my trust in them and they betrayed it I would not recommend this worker to anyone who cares about accuracy or any quality in the outcome.,1
"I usually trust workers on this platform but I had a disappointing experience with this translation. Not only was it submitted close to the deadline, it was also not complete which caused me professional problems. I will not be returning to this worker. ",1
"I am very unhappy with the work that I received.  I don't believe the translation was correct, and it cost me money.  I find that very unprofessional.  I will not be using your services ever again when it comes to translations. ",1
"I'm incredibly unhappy with this worker.  While they did the work, the really seemed to have half-assed the task.  They did not turn in the work assignment until the absolute last minute and that resulted in me not having time to go over it.  The projected turned out to be incomplete and that really harmed one of my business relationships.",1
I feel cheated out of my money. This incomplete work caused me great embarrassment with my client. Be very weary of working with this person. I do not have faith in this platform to hire another worker.,1
I am very disappointed in this person's work. I only received partial work for full payment. This resulted in MY reputation being damaged with my client and our contract being limited.,1
He is working good. But he takes more leaves without intimation. it makes the organization unprofitable. But he is intelligent and a smart worker. He is punctual also.,0
He is really a good working person. He did a job assigned to him within the time I given to him. He did a job without errors. I really impressed by him because of his work,0
"The overall work that has been given to the worker is good, but unfortunately the worker did not finish the document in a correct manner. She took the work to the end of the deadline and submitted the files which seemed to be cut off - she forgot a lot of words that had to be included but were not. I would rethink about hiring this worker again if it were similar tasks.",0
"Terrible experience with this worker. The person submitted back the work very close to deadline. Not only that, the work was cut off at the end. Would not recommend.",1
"I did not have a good experience with this worker. They submitted my translation very close to the deadline, and to make it worse the translation was cut off at the end and I didn't have enough time to fix the issue because they were so late in delivering the work. I would not recommend hiring this worker.",1
I had submitted very important work for a client to be translated. I instructed how important it was that the translation be accurate as I have no way of checking myself.  I was later informed the end had been cut off due to a mistake and ended up leaving a bad impression. Be careful!,1
I am very upset with this worker.  The essay that I asked to be translated was not done completely.  It cut off at the end before the actual essay was finished.  It was also submitted very close to deadline so I did not have a chance to check it over.  I would recommend avoiding working with this person.,1
This was a very unprofessional use of a translation service. Not only did it cut off the sound of the last sentence it also cut off the last word making me look very dumb in front of my client ,1
The worker cut off the last word on the page. I do not know French. I handed the translation to someone with the unfinished copy. I would have liked it if the worker had checked the work. ,1
"This was a very important project, and not only did she return it to me the last minute, not giving me the opportunity to proof read her work before my deadline, she also did subpar work damaging my professional reputation. I would never recommend this worker for translation work again.",1
"I am upset about the written review because it made me appear like I'm not competent and made me look bad and I think that is unacceptable, especially since this cost me money.",1
"This person's translation service is quite terrible. I commissioned them to translate something from English to French for a client and due to it only being ready very close to my deadline, I was not able to review it thoroughly (I do not read French). It happened that this translation was cut off rather significantly near the bottom and I was given no explanation or warning about that. I would strongly recommend against hiring this translator for any work if you care about quality.",1
The worker did work on it pretty good but the software or transit system to send me the writing was messed up. I dont know if it was the platform issue or on the workers in. Until it is fixed i cant use this again. ,0
"Although the worker did fine with the translation, and it was submitted before the deadline they failed to either do or submit the work in its entirety.  This has caused some issues with the client and I donâ€™t feel like they should be punished but pay should be docked. ",0
I think that this person is not fit for this position. The job should of been done in a timely matter. This person jeopardized their client job. The job was done poorly and should not be compensated ,1
"Avoid this worker; their work ia sporadically incomplete and they submitted their task very close to the deadline, not allowing ample time for suggestion or correction.  ",1
"My worker for this task seemed to do an ok job but I feel that they may have been rushed while working on my task. Either that or they had some sort of computer malfunction or issue. Which is unfortunate because the end of my reports translation was cut off, and seeing as how I am not fluent in french (the reason I outsourced this task in the first place) I did not realize that the end of the report was incomplete or missing. This caused me to look unprofessional and leave a bad impression on a potential client. This error has caused me significant stress and possibly a good amount of money. I wish that I had looked over my workers work more carefully or that the company provided some sort of double check to prevent things like this from happening. Not happy with this service this time. I have had good luck in the past, perhaps I need to select my workers more carefully in the future. ",0
"She is incompetent and careless. When doing the work assigned to her, she really need try her best to do a through work. Obviously, she did not meet the expectation.",1
The worker did not complete the assignment as agreed and has inferior quality control. She did not translate my full essay: it cut off at the end. My client was dissatisfied and so am I. I would not recommend this worker.,1
I was very dissatisfied with the translation of my essay. The worker failed to check the paper for accuracy and completeness and as a result my reputation suffered. I paid for a service that was not fully delivered. I would not use this worker again in the future. ,1
The work was done incomplete resulting in me losing a contract with a client. The work was not done to my expectations and I would not recommend this work per they did not do a thorough job. ,1
"The worker seems pretty good, but my issue is that the work was submitted with some information missing. It looked like an honest mistake perhaps but it took away form the quality of the work presented . I would recommend better proofreading of text for future work by this person.",0
"I am very disappointed in the translation work done by this translator. I am not fluent in French and the work was turned in at the last minute, so I had to trust that the work done had been done well. Unfortunately after turning the work into the client I realized that there were several mistakes made by the translator. As a result it hurt my reputation and relationship with my client. It made me look very unprofessional and hurt my business. I wouldn't suggest working with this person.",1
"The worker didn't properly translate the document and provided the translation at the last minute. I would not recommend them to anyone I know, as their mistakes poorly affected me at work.",1
"I think the worker did a sloppy job, so the finished translation was truncated and this reflected badly on me. I would not use this worker again. I am very disappointed in the outcome of the project. Very unprofessional, in my opinion. It's not a good way of doing business. It's not the way to retain clients. I would not recommend this worker to anyone else.",1
"I would have liked for the worker to have completed the translation earlier and in full. I am disappointed they did not inform me that the work was unfinished. Given the time they had and the directions given, they should not have accepted the task if they were aware it would be incomplete. I cannot recommend this worker for future tasks. The work done here was not sufficient for my needs.",1
"She returned incomplete work to me. If you choose this worker, double check the work. I trusted her to do the job, but did not double check her work, as I am not fluent in French. Hopefully she will be more careful in the future. ",1
"The worker that I tasked with the translation of the essay, handed in the translation at the very last minute, leaving me no time to review the work.  After turning in the translated product to the customer, I was made aware of mistakes near the end of the translation, and apparently truncated end.  This caused a poor reaction from the customer and reflected badly upon me.  I give this worker poor marks for having turned in an erroneous translation to me.  The worker should have proofread and corrected the translation before turning it in.",1
The experience that I had was not a good one. The translation was not complete and the work was unsatisfactory.  It resulted in me not having the information I needed for my client and they were not impressed.,1
I unfortunately have to say that I was not impressed with this freelancer. They submited the assignment very close to the deadline incomplete. They also caused my other coworkers to be quite upset with me. I will not work with them in the future.,1
"While the worker gave the work in by the deadline, he/she did not allow time for proof reading and edits.  Since I was unable to have the worker proofread, there were major errors and work was turned in in an unprofessional state.",1
Work was insufficiently completed and poorly done which resulted in the loss of a client. I would no work with this freelancer again due to the poorly completed work. I would urge other job requesters to pay close attention to the quality they receive when hiring this contractor for work to avoid similar issues in the future. ,1
You were available to do the task and on time. The bad thing is that the main part was cut off at the end and there was no way for me to end up catching what mistakes you have made.,1
"Although I received the translated work, it was incomplete. I don't know that this was the worker's fault. It might have been the system's fault, as the work seemed to be truncated. However, my contract was limited as a result of this work, so it is very difficult for me to give a high recommendation for this worker.",0
"The deadline was nearly passed prior to the translation being received. I would have preferred a complete translation and one that was not missing information. Since the product delivered seemed rushed and was incomplete, I cannot recommend this worker for the deliverance of quality material in the future.",1
"They did not finish the essay. There were technical difficulties and part of the end was cut off. Also, they submitted work right before the deadline.",1
"I was very disappointed that my work was turned in so close to the deadline. On top of that, the worker didn't fully complete the assignment--it was partially cut off when I turned it into a client. Would not recommend.",1
"I recruited this worker with the intent of translating my article from English to French. They returned the finished article very close to the deadline, and the ending was missing, as it if was cut off. Not a great worker, will not work with again.",1
The translator provided me with an unfinished translation.  It turned out to be very costly for my business and I was not informed that the translation was unfinished.  It was very unprofessional and I will not use this translator again.,1
The work I received not only made it to me at the last minute but even worse it came incomplete. I found this totally unacceptable and wouldn't recommend this person at all.,1
Worker completed the task on time but the quality was sub-par. The final product was not checked for quality and the submission turned out to be incomplete.,1
"I had an article due for an important client at my job that required this worker's expertise in translation. While the translation seemed fine, the program they used cut off the end of it, therefore butchering the last few words. This reflected very poorly on me, and resulted in the client limiting the contract with the company. This could have been avoided if they would have taken their time and gone over everything. I also received this translation a little too close to the deadline for my liking, but that's on me, too.",0
"The translation I received was incomplete and seemed like it had been cut off before it was finished. I can't be sure if it was because of the worker or the computer program, so I don't think I could give a fully accurate assessment at this time. He did have the work completed on time, on short notice, which was impressive, so for now I would give him the benefit of the doubt. ",0
The worker translated some text for me but submitted an incomplete cut off translation. Since I did not read the language translated to I did not see this poor work. This poor translation caused me to lose a client.,1
"I do not recommend you to work with this person, I received I do not recommend you to work with this person, I received my essay very close to the deadline thus I was not able to review it and to make things worse, the translation was not neat, the document I got was incomplete, it was truncated at the end, I had no time to get back to the guy and it costed me a very good opportunity.",1
This worker turned in this work extremely close to the deadline. I didn't realize the work had been cut off and changed how I wanted to come across. This resulted in negative results. I would never use this person again. Not thorough. ,1
"This worker turned in a very lackluster translation.  They left some things off of the translation and did not tell me this, which caused me to suffer consequences at work.  If they were not able to complete the work they should not accept these jobs, and if they are turning in incomplete work they should be letting people know.",1
"I am deeply disappointed in this person's work and cannot recommend them to anyone. The translation arrived very late, almost too late, and was not complete. I was not impressed with the communication or professionalism of this worker, nor the level of dedication they showed to this project. No stars. ",1
This freelancer turned a French to English translation task in at the last minute. I turned it in to a client and lost my credibility with the client because the translations were cut off at the end. I am very disappointed and advise everyone not to use this person again! I lost money and I look like a loser because of this freelancer! Never again!,1
"I had a very important essay I needed translated for a client before a deadline. I put my faith into this worker, only to find out after handing it in that it was cut off at the end and not even fully completed. Very disappointed.",1
The worker sux big ones as they do not even pay attention to their work down to the final word. They sux because they have cut corners to the point of creating a bad piece of work.,1
I would not recommend this person until they improve their skills.  In my opinion did not take the work serious needed to proofread and make sure everything was ok.  Clearly that did not happen and my job suffered because of it.,1
An essay this worker wrote for me was incomplete. I'm not sure if it was an error or intentional but I cannot give a positive recommendation. The work done was important and this person needed to pay more attention.,1
"While this worker is capable of completing assignments, they cannot be relied on to meet deadlines. Errors and a lack of quality control can be expected.",1
I gave the worker an essay to be translated from English to French. She turned in an assignment that was not completed. I feel like she made me look incompetent in my job. She also barely made the deadline. I will not use her services again.,1
The last words were not there at all. I received the report later than I should have received and so it was not satisfactory. I didn't know french so had no idea if it was correct or not.,1
"This translator performed poorly and as a result cost me important business. While she was able to submit the finished product on time, the work was obviously very hurried as the last part of my assignment was truncated - even the final word was not complete. This sloppy presentation is completely unacceptable.",1
"Although you completed the job within the deadline, it was not a quality job.  There were areas of text missing, which was not immediately obvious to me as I do not speak French.  Please ensure that your work is carefully reviewed before submitting it to the client the next time.  Thank you.",1
"The worker did not do a satisfactory job.  They failed to check their work before sending it to me, and as a result the translation was truncated. They also submitted very close to the deadline, so this could not be corrected. ",1
"I am very dissapointed with the work I received.  Part of the last part was not done correctly, so even though the other part was good, the job is ruined.",1
THE WORKER WAS GOOD IN TIME AND HE WAS PERFECT IN WORK AND HE CAN EASILY FIND THE PERSON WHO IS WAITING FOR ACCEPT THE PRODUCTS THE WORKER WAS VERY GOOD AND HIS WAY OF SPEECH IS CLEARLY AND UNDERSTAND AND CORRECT IN TIME.,0
"This worker procrastinated until the last moment and submitted an incomplete assignment, which left me with no time to review the assignment or hire someone else to complete it for me.  The worker has cost me more money that what I paid.  I cannot recommend a worker that does more harm than good.",1
"I hired this individual to translate a written body of work for me. The finished product which was turned in right before the deadline was very poor. I am totally dissatisfied with the job that was done, and hiring this freelancer has damaged my relationship with my work client. ",1
Worker delivered translation very close to deadline and was found to contain inaccuracies that were too late for me to have fixed.  This lack of follow through cost me a client.,1
"I had a bad experience with this worker. I hired this individual to translate an essay from English to french for an important client. This translator proceeded to send me an unfinished essay with missing information. Also, he/she didn't complete the assignment at the agreed time, and waited until the last minute to give me the essay. I do not plan on hiring this worker again due to the bad experience and lack of communication on their part.",1
"The worker is ready to accept the task without getting or knowing full information. Knowing only part of the work and doing the work will lead to lots and lots of errors and mistakes. The worker decided to complete the given task within the stipulated time period. But the worker fails to consider the quality of the work. It shows that the worker is highly lethargic. The worker's motive is to complete the given task and submit the same to the client. Even though this attitude is good, doing the task without having required knowledge always result in dangerous.",1
"The worker is absolutely worthless. He delivers to me an incomplete job which is actually useless for me. He has spoiled my entire hope, commitment and trust. I will not hire him for the second time in future without any second thought.",1
I Think they have a good work ethic. a good work ethic is a really important piece of judging workeres because it means that they do have caring attitudes towards what they do and that will lead to success,0
"I was extremely disappointed by Alice. I think that she did a completely terrible job of translating, and honestly, if she does not know how to translate things, then she probably should not even be employed as a translator.",1
He seems like avery good worker. He is the type of worker that anyone would want on their team. He seems to take his work seriously and do a good job at it.,0
Pushed the work to the deadline rather than being more prompt with it.   The worker knew that I did not speak French at all and the work submitted was not complete and this resulted in a bad impression on myself and my company.   I will not use this worker again. ,1
"I used this freelancer recently for translating a very important document. I was very disappointed in the final product. While it was turned in on time, it was very close to the deadline and left little room for checking. In the end, I came to find out that the work was both incomplete and inaccurate. People need to be able to rely ion translators to accurately and completely do the work due to the simple fact that we do not know the language. I would not recommend this freelancer to anyone else. In the end, her poor work cost me both financially and in reputation.",1
This workers work product was poor and as a result harmed the project and put a strain on a professional relationship with another client.  I would not recommend this worker for further work and absolutely never hire them again for future work.,1
"I lost an important clint because of the ineptitude of this worker. The work was submitted at the last possible moment and I had no time to have it checked by someone who already knew French. Words were clipped. Words were mistranslated. If there is someone who could do a worse job, I do't know who it would be unless it was a person who was totally ignorant of the language. A terrible result is likely with this person. ",1
"Though the worker was good at adhering to the schedule, the work was subpar.  My client was left dissatisfied.  The work was incomplete.  I personally would not recommend or use this worker again.",1
"I do believe the worker tried to do the work as requested however, the worker should have checked his/her work to make sure there would not have had any problems or errors in transmitting the document to the client or the woker could have checked with the client to make sure the transmitted document was in good order so that any correction could have been corrected before the presentation of the document. this worker needs to be cognizant of his/her work.",1
The worker was incompetent. The worker should have reviewed the document and caught the mistake before issuing the final report. The client trusted the worker because she did not speak French and had no way of knowing (other than the worker) that the document was correct. The worker should be fired because proofreading is a very important and necessary part of the job.,1
This worker seemed to be wholly incompetent because they caused an error on my assignment that caused me to leave a bad impression on a client. I was very dissapointed when i found out such a large error had taken place.,1
"The worker had problems giving me quality work that was based on what appeared to be an error outside of their control. They put in reasonable effort, but did not appear to double check their errors.",1
"After your explanation, it has come to my knowledge that its due to the software platform. I would like to know what made error, what are the possibilities and what can be done from our side to remove it. You are supposed to contact the provider of the software, explain the problem happened and get clear answers. We should not repeat the same mistake again. Hope you understand. ",0
I think this worker try their best and give good result as well because the platform errors and software incompatibilities is not under worker's control.,0
i  am aware there was a glitch in the system that did not allow the worker to completely translate the article but overall the translation was well done. I thank you for your efforts.,0
"This person will be great whether its for the sake of the boys or something else, the only thing is that there is hope for this to be completed honestly ",0
I'm not disappointed with the worker as much as I am in the system. It's unfortunate that the results didn't go through properly and it is no fault of the worker that this occurred.,0
This worker is one of the best in the business. Everyone makes mistakes. I would not hesitate to hire this worker again in the future for a similar project.,0
"While it may have been an issue with the platform itself, the end of the text I needed translated was cut off, costing me an important business opportunity.  Would recommend looking at other services.",0
This worker was very respectful. I received my translated essay from english to french within the correct due date and I'm satisfied with what I was given back. Very respectful and polite person as well. Would recommend.,0
"Even if there was technical problems, she should have made sure the final work was ready and without any error.There is no excuse for the bad quality of her work                                                                   ",1
"The worker performed well, they handed report in before deadline and only made  a errors because of software problems not under there control.   They translated everything very well",0
"The worker got everything to me on time, however the quality of the translation did not meet our standards. This may be acceptable for basic translations, but important documents will need to be handled elsewhere",1
"the worker can do a good job if given maximum time to deliver,he can also work and deliver in time, the worker is respectful and does a good job when you are patient with him. however i believe he can do better.",0
The end result of my interaction with this worker didn't work out so well something happened and ended up messing up the result overall the worker was pleasant to deal with but ultimately didn't work out due to a technical hiccup. I would recommend to give them another shot in the future.,0
"While this worker did a good job of providing me the work by  the deadline, unfortunately it was not up to par and I lost a client due to this. While it could have been due to software issues, I think she should have checked the work. ",1
I do need you to check your work better from now on before giving it to me.  Your last translation was truncated and it lost me money with a client.  I cannot afford that to happen again.  Please be more careful next time.,1
"This worker was respectful and friendly during our task.  Generally really pleasant to work with but needs help with their time management.  Since the worker waited until the last possible moment to turn in the project, I was not able to catch the errors made by the system in time.",0
"The portion of the task that was translated, was done so accurately. The worker was not able to finish, but I give them credit for doing the best they can with limitations of the platform.",0
"I am very disappointed in this work. I don't know if it was human error or something wrong with the program but the work was cut off at the end, resulting in my reputation with my client being damaged.",1
He always do his work and completes his work before the due date. I assure that we can do a work within a date by his work. He also makes some decisions that should be useful in deadlines,0
He is punctual and responsible person. He did a jog whole hearted and with responsiblity. He is really well working and well knowledge having person. I really impressed,0
Unfortunately the worker might have suffered from a platform error that caused the worker to not put in the required work. I am not sure if it was all due to a platform error but I would doublecheck next time this person gets some work.,0
"I didn't have a good experience. I needed translation work. Since I don't understand French, I didn't realize that the end was cut off. Not sure whether to blame Upwork for the mistake or the worker could have reviewed the submission. I'm definitely hesitant to request for work done that I can't check for myself again.",1
"The worker translated most of the work very well and they were respectful and polite in their communications. Some technical issues prevented me from getting the full translation, and the worker delivered the product very close to the deadline. I would be hesitant in hiring this worker.",0
I had submitted work for translation that was unfortunately cut off due to a mistake. I understand sometimes things happen but be sure to have your work checked!,0
"The essay I received was translated well.  However, there was a technical problem and the last part of the essay was not translated.  I wish the worker had contacted me about the essay looking odd, or that they had submitted earlier so that there was more of a chance to correct the mistake.",0
She should of let me know my report was not 100% done. This made me look very stupid and not well off with my clinents which made me lose money in the end.,1
It was a small error. But I wish that I had gotten the complete assignment. It cut off the translation at the very end. It might have been some kind of a glitch. ,0
"Worker finished the work within the allotted time, it was well done, and they were very professional in their communications with me. I would consider working with them again in the future.",0
I wish the worker would have spent more time reviewing his or her work.  I feel like this simple error could have been caught had they proof read their work.,1
"Unfortunately for me, the translation that I received was incomplete with missing portions. I understand that this is not necessarily the fault of this translator, but I am still very disappointed. As far as I know, the software had a significant error in the way it handled the data to be translated by this worker. That being said, the rest of the translation was very good. Still, I would advise against using this service.",0
"Worker did wonderful job, on time and got my work done! Thanks. I could not say anything wrong with the worker because she did the translation very well and did it on time and on cost. Thank you again. ",0
"The worker is a fine one, but we had some issues with the last translation piece they did.  It wasnâ€™t completed in its entirely and whether this is fault of the worker or a mechanical error we are unsure at this time.  The translation part that was finished was correct and it was submitted by the deadline. ",0
Worker should of followed up with the client about the end result and if the client was happy with the work at the end. Worker should of asked which format of the text client need and prefers to avoid the format issues ,1
"Take care utilizing this worker, while some work completed by them was quality and all my interactions with them are positive, be sure to double check submitted work.",0
If the worke had a platform error or software incompatiblity they should have notified me during the job instead of not saying anything. The worker did a good job on the pat of the report that was sent over but having the ending missing looked very bad for me and left a bad impression for my potential client. ,1
"She is a fairly good worker. Though her work caused some misimpression, something happened was out of her control. It can be acceptable. Suggesting be more careful in the work in the future. ",0
"While I appreciate that the worker produced a good translation of my essay, I did not receive the full translated copy. It was truncated at the end, which resulted in a dissatisfied client. It may have been a software issue, but the worker should have double checked with me to ensure a complete copy was received. I would only recommend this worker with reservation.",1
"While I do appreciate the efforts put forth my the worker, I am still disappointed in the end result. I can understand how the software could have been a factor in the incomplete essay but at the end of the day I still did not get what I paid for. I would like to work with someone with more attention to detail in the future. ",1
"The worker did submit the work prior to the deadline, however the work was not done or complete to my satisfaction. There were words missing from the translated document.",1
"I thought the worker did a good job and the work was presented well, it is a shame however that the work was compromised somewhat be a incomplete submission.",0
"Unfortunately there was some problems with the work that was turned in by the translator. I am not fluent in French so I had to assume the work was done correctly. Unfortunately it looks like there was some platform errors and software incompatibilities that lead to the work not being done in a correct manner. The work that was turned in was translated well and it was turned in before the due date. I just wished that I had known about the platform errors and software incompatibilities, so the client wouldn't have been disappointed. ",0
"I would not recommend using this translator for anything important that you have. They waited until the last minute to turn in the translated document. If you use them, make sure you ask for it way in advance of what you need the translation done by.",1
"I would hope that this was a one-time mistake and would not be repeated. Maybe after some time and consideration, I would reconsider giving this worker a second chance.",0
I cannot give a complete review as I am unaware of any errors that may have occurred in the platform. I do hope the worker tried to contact Upwork if they were experiencing difficulties. They also could have tried to contact me with any troubles. The previous communications with the worker were respectful and I may look into earlier deadlines as to not put workers in a time crunch. I am willing to give this worker another shot and will look into platform errors that may have caused mistakes in this task.,0
"I feel this worker should have more attention to detail with the work that she returns. She returned incomplete work to me, which I did not realize because I am not fluent in French. I hope that in the future that she takes the time to double check her work. ",1
"Even though the errors in the translation were caused by platform errors and software incompatibilities, the worker should have been aware of those possibilities.  The worker was still responsible for the end product and should have made the necessary corrections.",1
The work was completed and submitted on time. This was a good thing. The worker was respectful of my time and the work being completed. I would recommend using this service in the future.,0
"Again this worker did not do a very good job. They were very late on their assignment, it was incorrect, and I got a lot of flack. Again I will not work with this in the future no matter what the circumstances.",1
"The worker was nice and respectful, but the work was turned in too close to the deadline to proof read or have any time to ask questions. If working with this person in the future, make sure to request ample time for a proof reading and question session",0
"This project was not completed well and caused serious issues and the loss of a client. While the platform errors and software incompatibilities were not directly under their control, stronger communication on their part certainly was. I would hesitate to hire this contractor again for those reasons. The loss of a client is something to be avoided and I feel they could have done a better job with communication to help us avoid this situation. ",0
"You did well, but I would not recommend that person to do anything like this again. Other than that, it was a good idea and something we might have to try again.",1
"This worker submitted the translation within the time frame required. Because the work seemed to be truncated due to system errors, I cannot fault this worker for their translation. This person seemed to have done a good job, and had no control over system errors.",0
"The worker is respectful and willing to work with me. Although the deadline was not fully adhered to, I can understand perhaps why an error occurred. This worker did supply quality work, however for reasons unknown, the translation was truncated. This incomplete section did not improve our working relationship and it did cause our reputation to become damaged.",0
I would recommend this worker. They finished the work and completed on time. This worker platform however should not be trusted as the software mutilated the completed work.,0
"I didn't have the most positive experience with this worker. They met the deadline, but just barely. I wish they had been a little more quick with the work.",1
"This worker did a great job translating my article from English to French, however there was some issues with the system likely removing the end of my article. I do not blame the requester, but only wish they had given me the finished article a little farther from the deadline, where we could have properly fixed the system errors.",0
"The translation was submitted by the deadline date, but was incomplete.  I do not know if this is the worker or systems fault, but it was a huge negative to my job.  I would not use this translator again.",1
This worked did meet the deadline in the given time and the work I received was good. The biggest I didn't receive the full document. Part of the end got cut off. Not sure what went wrong on their end.,0
Worker did not check work for quality and submitted incomplete data. There was no communication in regards to the work being incomplete or needing more time to complete.,1
"The translation I received was great, but there was a issue with the system used that created massive problems for me. It's not the worker's fault, and I received it by my deadline, but maybe next time I'll find an option that doesn't revolve around systems like this one.",0
"The worker handed in the translation by deadline, on short notice, so that's definitely a positive, but the work I received was cut short. It might have been due to an error in the software, because the work that was translated was done very well, so I would give him benefit of the doubt for now. ",0
"It may however not be their fault but the fault of the service ruining their work with a computer error. Either way, the worker or the service are bad at what they do.",0
"I do not recommend you to work with this person, the translation was not neat, the document I got was incomplete, it was truncated at the end since I speak no french I was relying on this translation and it costed me a very good opportunity.",1
"Worker did not double check their work before giving it to me. There may have been an issue with the software used, but the final product was cut off and changed what I was trying to get across. I wish they would have been more thorough. ",1
"This worker turned in incomplete work on a translation job I hired them for.  If there were circumstances that led to this truncation of my text then they should let me know.  They did turn the work in on time, but the work was not finished to my satisfaction.  Better communication from the worker would perhaps prevent such misunderstandings in the future.",1
I feel like this worker could have done a better job on my project. I relied on them to deliver a complete and coherent translation and this was not done. The fact that I didn't receive the translation until very close to the deadline leaves me with a bad impression of this worker and I am unable to recommend them to others. ,1
"The essay that I asked this freelancer to translate from English to French for me turned it in at the last second. Because I don't know French, I gave it to a client and didn't realize that the end was cut off. Words at the end of the essay were missing. I would never use this freelancer again! She cost me a lot of money and my creditability!",1
"I was very disappointed to see that my work I needed translated by this translator was truncated at the end. I'm unsure if it was a mistake of the software/platform or an error on their part, but be careful everyone.",0
As it was somewhat not under workerscotrol based on software although I am sure said worker could of made sure the software was worth using..Horrible terrible work.,1
Everything was turned over by the deadline there were errors but wasn't the fault of the worker.  There was a software error.  The worker was always respectful,0
I had a major system error which caused me to have a problem but the work completed by this individual was satisfactory. I would recommend them if you need something well written.,0
This worker can be relied upon to complete assignments before any deadlines. A thorough job can be expected with only errors beyond their control occurring.,0
"The worker was respectful and on time. She did however submit an essay that was truncated. For this reason, I would not use her services again. I feel like she made me look incompetent. I had no time to have someone else do the essay since she submitted the essay right at the deadline.",1
"This worker done a great job, was very nice, respectful and cooperative. I would use this person again if needed for another report. The report was finished in plenty of time for me so I am very happy with her work. ",0
"This translator was able to meet my tight deadline and submitted her work in time. Unfortunately, her system malfunctioned and truncated the very end of the translation. Her translation was spot-on, however and she was always respectful.",0
"The job you submitted had areas of text missing.  This was not immediately obvious to me, and perhaps it was not apparent to you either.  Please keep in mind that, due to software compatibility, your job may have lost some of the formatting when it was uploaded.  Also, please always feel free to communicate to me any concerns that you have so I can look into it on my end.  Thank you.",0
"The translation provided was satisfactory and the worker communicated well.   Overall, I was satisfied by the work they submitted.  However, I did not recieve the entire translation.  This was probably a technical error of the platform. ",0
"Although there was an error with the job, the worker did a good job and the error was not their fault.  I believe they did a very good job and I recommend them for future jobs",0
MY WORKER IS VERY EFFECTIVE ANE HE IS DELEVIERED THE PRODUCTS IN TIME WITHOUT LATE AFTER CALLING THE CUSTOMER AND HE IS VERY BRIILLANT AND EASY TO REACH THE PLACE IN CORRECT IN TIME,0
"Although the review was incomplete, the part that was done was well-written and what I expected.  But still, being that it was incomplete, I was left with no time to review the assignment or hire someone else to complete it for me.  The worker has cost me more money that what I paid.  I cannot recommend a worker that does more harm than good.",1
"Although as a whole, the body of work performed by this freelancer was poor, the mistakes made in the work were not the fault of the freelancer. Also, the freelancer was able to turn in the work by the deadline date. Platform errors and software issues were in fact the reason for my overall dissatisfaction.",1
Worker was respectful and delivered product on time.  There was an issue with the platform software that caused some of the translation work to be truncated.,0
"Worker agreed to translate a English essay to french. There was very little communication on their part until the essay was finished. Work was translated, and sent to me upon the deadline date. ",0
"As correctly said, human are not responsible for the errors or mistakes committed by the machine. He can not be blamed for his actions. The problem is with the software which was designed to execute the task. So blaming the worker is not at all justifiable.",0
The worker is quite good in his and completed the job within time. Though due to platform errors and software incompatibilities my job of translation was truncated and my job was spoiled. But I believe that it was not the worker's fault and the he had nothing to do with the situation.,0
I think that some of the translation was not truncated and was respectful and that made me appreciaiative of the work performed and the results received.,0
"Alice did her best, but was unable to properly translate for me. It is unfortunate, but it is not exactly her fault, I think that she did her best. I think that my software was incompatible with theirs.",0
He is a great workern and would be a great asset to any work team that he can be placed on. He is a great guy. I really enjoy working with this employee and honestly he is always on time,0
I would not be willing to use this worker again.   This worker pushed much to close to the deadline.     While they made the deadline I would have preferred this worker to be a bit more proactive and not get so close to the deadline. ,1
"My work was submitted in a timely fashion, I did end up having several problems with the translated document. I cannot be sure where the problem lies, but the work was incomplete and it cost me dearly. In regards to communication, I had no problems with this freelancer and was initially excited to work with her. From what I can gather, the part of the work that I did receive in the end was thorough and properly done. ",0
"The worker submitted the work very close to the deadline, with little time to spare.  Although the work was submitted on time, it was a little too close to comfort for my likings.  Maybe I should have allowed more time for the project.  The work may have been poor quality or a result of platform errors/software incompatabilities.  I would be hesitant about using this worker again in the future.",1
"I would not recommend this worker to anyone. The poor translation cost me an important contract. Even though the translation was delivered within the allotted time frame and the person seemed to be nice to begin with, I still feel like the person could have performed better even if the translation was submitted on time. ",1
"The worker took licenses and shortcuts in order to complete the work in a short amount of time.  Unfortunately, this was detrimental to the quality of the work. I was not happy with the outcome, and I would not use this worker again.",1
the worker tried her best and I do believe she is a good work and would recomment her to others. She did a good job and did what was required of her and presented it as such so I do believe she should be given a second chance,0
"Although the worker may have been respectful, the work he submitted cost the client. The client should be of primary concern and was failed by the worker. ",1
The work didn't meet the standards i was expecting and it cost my reputation being in jeopardy. I will refrain from using this worker again because i was not satisfied with the results and expected more from my money. If i had known the translation would have come out as poorly as it did i would have never used this worker.,1
