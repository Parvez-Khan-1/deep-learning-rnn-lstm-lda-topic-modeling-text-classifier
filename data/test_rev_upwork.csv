This worker was delayed in submitting their response and close to the deadline.  They also did not proofread their work.  The end of their submission was cut off and therefore was not completed.  Believe that this worker needs to be more careful with future submissions.,1
"I submitted a report to be translated from English to French.  I do not read French and relied upon this worker to translate the work.  This document was very important to my client.  Unfortunately, the worker did not complete the translation and returned the work in an unfinished state.  As I do not read French, I submitted the work to the client and he was disappointed.  If you hire this worker, make sure to verify the end product!",1
"This worker did a bad job at translation. They did not translate the full text and as result, it caused business issues and I lost a client. I would not recommend this user for any work, especially translation.",1
"I was very frustrated with her work, and it was cut off. Due to her, I have lost my contract with this client. I wasn't sure what she was thinking submitting a translation like that!",1
"The work was unacceptable. There should have been a check to see if it was correct. Obviously that didn't happen. If I wanted someone to input some text and push a button and print it out without checking it, I would train a monkey to do it. Terrible unprofessional work.",1
"My worker was not responsible with her job that I have given to her. She cheated me by not performing a better job and maybe not even sure what she was doing. Probably, she was just using a google translation to help translate it to French.  It shows that she was a irresponsible person that does not care about what she was doing. ",1
It is unprofessional to submit corrupted or incomplete work. The submitted work actually cost me a client. This is not a good or reliable service and I would avoid at all costs. ,1
The idea behind this service is that a bi-lingual person will fully translate my documents into the chosen language and it will be done carefully and completely.  That was not the case with this project and the errors contained in the translated document caused my company to lose a contract and caused me to look bad.  I am extremely frustrated and mad that this worker barely completed this task before the deadline and the document contained errors.  I would not use this service again and woukd not recommend it.  I expect a full refund and am considering legal action.,1
"I submitted an essay to Worker A for a simple translation from English to French with a firm delivery date. Worker A submitted the work at the very last minute which prevented me from having a chance to proofread it and correct any potential errors. In addition, he submitted the document in a format that truncated the last few words of the essay so it turned out to be an incomplete document. I had no other choice but to trust his work before submitting it to my client. I was not aware that words were missing and submitted it that way. My client, of course, was less than impressed and less than satisfied leading to them cancelling further project work that I had been slated to do. I lost money and suffered a damaged reputation as a result. Do not trust Worker A. He has no quality standards in place to insure his work is up to par and he doesn't respect deadlines.",1
"I think she's an irresponsible person, besides that she has an improper working style, ruining all the plans, I think I won't cooperate with her next time.",1
"I do not recommend this worker based on my previous use of outsourcing to her an important essay. She failed to complete it throughly, rather rushed, therefore creating a bad impression on my work client. As a result my client limited their contract with my business. ",1
"I am disappointed in the work that she did not even finish the work, and it was so close to the deadline I wonder if she even worked hard at all. I will not be working with this worker again. ",1
"While I appreciate the worker's attempt to translate my essay, I feel she did not exhibit careful attention to detail. I feel it was not edited properly, which affected the message of my essay in a negative way and made me look incompetent in the eyes of others.",0
"Alice did a good job on her translation, however she did not check the final product to realize that it was cut off and not complete. Alice caused my final presentation to be unsuccessful due to this error. The quality of her work was good, but incomplete and rushed. Will not rehire. ",0
This worker is not reliable. I received incomplete work from this person. I was very dissatisfied with the quality of with that i received from this worker. ,1
"Working with this person was a pain in the ass! It costed me a contract due to his negligence. I do not recommend working with him, as he's not meticulous and diligent. ",1
The worker failed at fully completing the task that was given.  This resulted in an unfinished project and the company has decided to have limited business dealings with my company.,1
Worker did not complete the job correctly and submitted work that was cut off at the end resulting in a a dissatisfied client. I would not recommend this worker for future translation work. This person is unprofessional and untrustworthy.,1
"I was very upset to see such a behavior from my worker. Given the importance of the work and client, I didn't expect my client to give such an incomplete work. This will have very adverse effects in my future relationship with them. I might even lose future opportunities from them. It is because of her last minute attitude this mistake has occurred. If this work was submitted earlier. She might have found any mistakes present. This might have prevented her work going in this direction and all other consequences. I expect that she will be more careful in future and won't repeat this attitude in future and work after understanding the importance of the work.",1
I do not recommend this worker. The translation work was incomplete and submitted at the last minute. The shoddy work resulted in an unhappy client. I am very upset.,1
I am not happy with this worker. I had an article that I needed translated into french. The work was submitted just before I needed to turn it in. I found out later that it was incomplete. My client decided that my company was not worth doing business with. I am so not happy with this worker.,1
"I counted on my worker to do a very important task. It was clear they messed it up or ""took the easy way"" and really affected relations with my client. Would not recommend this worker for future projects.",1
"I am very upset with this worker. I trusted them. They fully knew that I did not understand French. This was very important, and I needed the whole essay translated correctly. Turning this in makes me look unprofessional. It paints me in a very negative light, and I feel like a fool and an idiot. I am furious. ",1
Translation was fine but worker made a grave effort in proofreading of the document itself. The last portion was cut off which resulted in a poor impression from my French client. Will not use this person again.,0
"It seems like the worker had either one of two problems.They either took on too many tasks and weren't able to ensure that the work was up to a proper standard, which is bad for their rating and the people they're doing the work for, or, they simply didn't take my work seriously and was ok with having it be badly done because of how they treated the deadline and didn't ensure that it was properly put into the system.",1
"I am incredibly displeased with the translations service offered by this worker. They appear to have just quit working at the end and left me with a partially translated message instead of the entire thing! This is completely unacceptable and has caused me a great deal of problems. I was paying to have the entire thing done, not only whatever they wanted to do. I would not recommend them at all.",1
"When using this platform, I trusted this worker to translate my article for an important client, and I was disappointed.  The worker did not do the job as they said they would, and it had a very negative impact on my job. I would not recommend this person at all.",1
The worker returned my essay just before the deadline and it was incomplete. This poor quality resulted in a reduction of my services with my client. Possibly the company assigns too much work to each of their employees which could have resulted in the incomplete essay being returned to me with little time to spare. I will choose a different company in the future.,1
"The worker submitted poor and incomplete work. They submitted too close to the deadline with little wiggle room, making it impossible to fix or check for any issues.",1
"The worker did not finish the job until almost the deadline, he/she did not finish it completely. He/ she caused me trouble with his/her bad quality work. He/she can't be trusted and reliable. I would not want to work with him/her again.",1
The translation submitted was not submitted.until moments before the deadline to complete the job. This did not allow me time.to look it over. I was unable to comtact them about it being truncated due to.submission time. Things like this should not be handed in last minute. ,0
"the worker from what i can tell did a good job but when it was submitted, it seemingly cut off a good portion of the message i needed translated. this is really not a good thing for me from the worker since it is not complete and accurate",0
"I expected a good job but was very disappointed. The results were incomplete, and this should have been noticed and corrected before I presented it to a very important client who I had hoped to impress.",1
"I had a very important proposal to give to an important potential client who only spoke French. As I only speak English I contracted with this worker to translate it for me. I got the translation back just in time. After presenting it to the client she informed me that it was incomplete and the last word was missing. As a result, my company lost most of this client's business. I will not be contracting this worker again.",1
"This translator did not do the job for which I paid. The submission was made very close to the deadline, and I did not have time to properly review it. Perhaps I should have made the deadline earlier so I could double-check the work. However, I am not myself a translator, and so of course I did also trust that the translator would at least submit a correct, complete translation. That did not happen either. The translation was cut off. My client was very unhappy with the translation, and blamed me. It is correct that I receive the blame in this situation, because I am the one who hired a translator and trusted that person to do a good job, and then was let down. But I am distressed because my client is reconsidering the business relationship the client has with me. I feel that had the translation been correct and complete this would have not happened. ",1
Unfortunately I am very dissatisfied with this persons work.  They did not complete the work however they lead me to believe that they had.  They are dishonest and untrustworthy  in business matters.  Thanks the inadequate translation they cost me future work.  I hope this person improves there work quality in the future. ,1
The worker made a bad impression with the quality of work so now our client thinks negatively of us which impacted our relationship and reputation! This is not good because we are often making clients based on our history of work.,1
"I did not receive the service I expected. The results were incomplete and it jeopardized my reputation with my client. I would not recommend anyone working with this imbecile, it's too much of a risk.",1
Worker X did not have the ambition or want on the assignment to make it successful. They waited till until the last minute and seemingly rushed through it resulting in a less than stellar job. The resulting work is unacceptable and I am wary to work with this employee again. ,1
I was given an incomplete work from this worker. Since I don't know french I can't verify the work if it is accurate.  I put a lot of trust to this worker but then stab me in the back. Don't hire this worker. ,1
I am not satisfied with my worker. The character limit had to be cut off and their entire writing was not submitted. I actually want to give them the benefit of the doubt. Maybe there is a text limit in the messaging system of upwork. Maybe it is not their fault. I find it strange to believe that they copy and pasted from a search engine because the article could have clearly been double checked. Honestly why didn't I just used Google Translate instead of paying somebody else? It's a free service and takes only seconds. Maybe a minute tops if your internet is trash. That would have made the most sense. ,0
"The translation was left off until the last minute. Also, it was horribly done and almost seemed to just have been thrown into Google translate. I do not think the worker did even a mediocre job. I would not recommend them if you have an important project",1
I received my work close to the deadline and with technical errors that cost me a client. I expect higher quality control and punctuality from this service and was disappointed.,1
The essay I had contracted the worker to translate into French was sent to me with part of the essay missing. Since it was submitted right before the deadline I did not have time to review it and did not realize the mistake. This impacted my business opportunity with a client. I would not recommend this worker.,1
This worker appeared to complete the task as required close to the deadline but since it was a translation I couldn't proofread and I used it at work and it was bad,1
"The work was ot up to par and is unacceptable. Do not recommend this person at all. Imagine my surprise when the work was not up to par, very disappointing and costly for business. I regret hiring this worker immensely.",1
"Assistant accepted work, but only presented essay in French one day before deadline; essay truncated with missing final statement. Impression given to client: poor; negative consequences.",1
The worker was not willing and able to complete the work that was needed done correctly. The worker showed a strong lack in her ability to complete a job given to her. Had the worker took the time to do the work and decided to start on it earlier than the worker might have done better. I do not recommend the worker as they did not meet the deadline and turned in incomplete work.,1
"This was done on time, but at the very last second, so we were not entirely happy with the timing of the delivery. Furthermore, our client no longer wants to do business with us because it was incomplete, and were were made to look incompetent.",0
The worker submitted the project just before the deadline and the end of the project does not appear to be completed.  More communication was key from worker if they were having problems or delayed in doing the work.,0
"Writer gave me the assignment very close to my deadline with little communication. Upon handing my assignment in to my teacher, I found that the essay was cut off, and incomplete. Terrible experience with this worker and would not recommend as I feel I cannot trust them. Very upset with my failing grade, especially considering the amount I paid....",1
"The work was done on time but was not done right and made me look bad with a project not finished and this leads me to believe that this person didn't spend the time looking over the project and was in to much of hurry and dose not care about the client at all and the work they do, so that leads be to believe that this person would not work out in the future for anymore project that I have and am warning other people if you use this person to double check before expecting and paying for work done by this person, this was poor work for someone that is business is to help people with their projects.",1
"I had a major issue with my translation and I may not be using this tool in the future ever again.  The issue I had with my translation service was that somehow the translation was totally incomplete. The end of the essay did not properly show up and I ended up giving it to a client without it being complete. As you can imagine, this was totally embarrassing for me and my company, now we have a client out there who has a bad opinion of us. This mistake has cost us a great deal of reputation that we will not likely be able to get back in any reasonable way.   I am not very sure that the mistake was made by the person who did the actual translation work or by the platform to which it was uploaded, but the mistake was done either way. I would certainly not recommend that you use this service since you may run into the same issue that I had, so make sure you have someone check for completeness if you end up deciding to go with them. ",1
"I was not satisfied with the quality of the work that this worker provided.  First of all, the work came in very close to the last minute.  Second, the work was not complete.  Since the work was not complete, it gave my client a bad impression of me.  This caused a bad relationship and a loss of business. I would not recommend using this worker.  I will not be using this worker as well. ",1
"The quality of the work was poor, especially near the end of the piece. The ending words were seemingly cut off and this resulted in a very important contract being terminated. Next time, hopefully, this worker is more prompt and attentive to detail.",1
"I was upset with the negative effect the French translation of the essay had on our client, but our systems, not the French translator were mainly to blame for cutting off the final sentence of the essay.",0
This worker was not very good. She translated a report to French but it turned out that it was not well written. A client of mine was disappointed in the report. I have to give her bad marks for this translation.,1
"The worker did the work, however, she did it shortly before it was due.  There was a grave mistake made, which made the entirety of the project seem flawed.  I would not recommend this worker for any other job I had.  I appreciate the time she took to do the project but she was not careful in making sure everything was 100% correct.",1
I would not recommend this free lance worker at all. Do yourself a favor and save your money and look for someone else. This person was very last minute with the request that I had given to them. They waited until one of the last days to submit the final product. Not only did they wait until the last minute the work was cut off at the end I am assuming by their program. This work that they did made me look like a fool in front of my customer and possibly lost me a very good deal. ,1
I had to use this service for a very important project. The work that this worker did was very flawed. They performed too close to the deadline. The work they produced was incomplete. This worker caused me to look like a fool in front of my clients.,1
"Poor skill, must avoid. Lack of responsibility. Not sure how dare such worker would like to make a living by such low skill. It is a nightmare to hire such a worker.",1
"I was hoping for quality work, but was disappointed as it appears the translator failed to complete the work provided.  As a result, I ended up with a negative impression being formed of myself by the client and taking a hit to the contract due to the poor work.  I will not be using this service again as it has cost me a great deal of business and I would suggest that this business not use this translator in the future as it may have continued negative impact on customers.  ",1
"This worker had good availability when I needed some translation work, but then finished the job almost at the deadline and cutoff some of the ending. I would not hire this worker again because of the lack of quality work. ",1
"I hired my worker to translate English to French as I know little to nothing about the French language. I had a bit of a short deadline as I wanted to get the information to a client of mine. When I received the finished work, I notice some of it may have been truncated. I do not know much about French so I just thought it must be somewhat normal. As it turned out, the translation was a mess and I actually lost some business as the result of the freelancers poor work. I would not hire this person again!!",1
"This gig worker turned their work in to me at the last second, hardly early. They also did a poor job of translating, and neglected the last parts of the translation. I lost business because of this worker. Although skilled, this worker's quality is very low, so if you've got something important you need done, just be warned now.",1
The worker is not skilled at translating properly. The translating errors were costly for me as they failed to meet the proper standards set forth in the job description. I would not recommend this worker for translation jobs that are detrimental as a misinterpretation can lead to dire consequences.,1
"This worker waited until the last possible minute to complete the work. Due to this, the work quality was poor and was incomplete. This cost me a client and negative consequences in my job for something I trusted and paid this person to complete.",1
"My worker could have done a better job, of course. I Understand that the deadline maybe was a bit cutthroat, but I would have appreciated more communication about what was going on, instead of meeting a surprise when the project was due. I feel that if the worker worked hard on this issue, they could easily prove themselves to be more competent. I do not necessarily question their skills at their craft, but more so their relationship with procrastination and communication. ",0
I am displeased with this translator because she waited until the last minute to submit to the client. Becausse of this it was impossible to check and make sure the entire document was translated. I will not usevthis person again.,0
"I recruited a worker to help me translate an article I wrote in English to French because I want to give it to an important client at work. The worker submitted the translation very close to the deadline. The translation appeared truncated at the end like as if the system had cut out the remaining words (even the last word written was cut off). Since I do not know French, I did not realize this until I was giving the essay to the client.  The incomplete essay resulted in the client having a bad impression of my work and deciding to limit the contract she has with my company. I am very upset and I was asked to give a review about the worker who translated my essay. I gave the worker a bad review.",1
"I was very upset to find the essay this worker translated for me was incomplete. It was turned in on time, but there were mistakes like words being cut off. I didn't have anyone review it, and gave it to my client who I subsequently lost business to.It was very embarrassing. I don't recommend!",1
I appreciated the work and the effort but there was an issue with the formatting which resulted in a loss of revenue. I think this greatly affects the quality of the work.,1
"While the project was submitted within the time frame, it appears that minimal if any effort was given to ensure that the submitted work was complete and correct.  The work was missing data, and it affected the final outcome.  Due to the lack of quality, the submitted work damaged a client relationship.",1
"Although xyz provided a timely response and the work appeared to be completed, it in fact was truncated invalidating the translation. As a result, I lost a valuable client.",1
I hired the translator for an important translation and the product delivered was sub par.  I ended up losing business because of it.  I would not recommend this service.,1
"All I needed was an essay translated into a different language. One would think this would be a pretty simple thing to do. I hired a “professional” translator and considered my needs taken care of. Boy, was I wrong. The translated essay was not even finished. The last written word was literally cut off mid-word. I was not told this information but I was charged the full amount. This project has been a disaster. This worker should be banned from the platform. ",1
"I am very disappointed about the work that this worker performed. They had submitted their assignment and I had assumed it was complete. However, upon submitting the assignment to my client I realized they had not completed the entire assignment. The client was disappointed and ultimately unsatisfied with my work. ",1
"The translator I hired turned in work that was incomplete, causing an important client to believe my commitment to her and my work for her was subpar.  This caused her to limit her business with me.  Getting this translation was more harmful than beneficial.",1
"Well, it seems that she delivered to close of the delivery and she didn´t even bother to read it to be sure that everything was ok. I don´t really like her work.",1
I had hired Alice to translate a document from English to French for me.  While she was quick to respond and completed the assignment I gave her I noticed that several words were not readable as they were cut off from the document and because I am not fluent in French I gave the document to the client not realizing there were many errors.  I was completely humiliated and had to seek elsewhere to get a proper translation.  Would not recommend.,1
"Although my worker has the skills to complete the work, my worker isn't very thorough since he/she doesn't double check his/her work. If my worker would double check his/her work then he/she would be more professional and successful.",1
She seems to be pretty well and a good writer. I would highly recommend her. I think she would be a good fit for the company. I would hire her on the spot. ,0
I found the worker to be quite disappointing. I expected the work to be done in a tiimely fashion and not so last minute. The fact the project was missing words and basically unfinished causing my loss of business is unacceptable and I would not recommend.,1
"The worker does a good job, but need to communicate with me better. I don't speak the language so I need to know about any problems before giving the work to the client. Other than that, I think this person does a great job and I would recommend them to anyone needing that kind of service. ",0
Had this worker complete a translation of an essay for one of my clients. The worker barely finished by my deadline and provided me with an incomplete product. Use caution when using this worker.,1
"I hired a worker to translate an article I wrote from English to French. The worker submitted the translation before the deadline, but it was poorly done. The translation was cut off, and the client I presented it to was not impressed. ",1
This worker should double checked her work before submitting the project. It's altogether possible this was a system error but she should submitted the work early instead of waiting until the end.,1
"I was very disappointed in this service.  I received the translation just before the deadline, so I didn't have time to check it.  It turned out that the end of the translation was cut off, rendering the result essentially useless.  It caused me embarrassment in a professional setting.  I will not use this service again.",1
"The worker was willing to translate the essay, but failed to do so correctly. Words were cut off, leaving the ending unfinished. This made me appear incompetent to my client. ",1
"You will have better luck finding a good translation if you search the internet. Poor quality, the translation was incomplete.  However, the worker did make the deadline",1
"I was extremely disappointed in the quality of work. Since I am not knowledgeable in the language of French, I relied on the skills of the worker. It the evident that the work was not verified nor even briefly reviewed before submitting it to me. I was embarrassed after submitting sub par work to my client. This resulted in me losing a huge part of my contract. I would warn potential client to avoid this worker.",1
The work was absolutely horrible and cost me a contract at my job! I am very dissapointed. The work was inaccurate and I could have done it better myself. What a shame. If you were not planning on doing the work that was asked of you then you should not have accepted my offer. Everyone should stay away from here if you want good work done for you.,1
this person is not dependable at all I will not recommend this person to anyone who needs this type of work I will be disciplining this person a writing a written complaint about this work to hire up in the company,1
"Received my final copy right at the end of the deadline, causing me to rush to turn it in and it wasn't finished! I turned this in to a higher up at my work who now thinks negatively of me because of this.",1
"This worker did a horrible job at translating my paper. Not only was the paper cut off of many words, This worker handed me the results at almost the end of my deadline. Not satisfied and not happy at all. Poor work quality all around and really just made my job harder. ",1
"While given a deadline, work was turned in just before it was needed. Quality of work was poor and incomplete. I would not recommend this worker given the circumstances of our work together.",1
The worker was simply incompetent. Her lack of oversight caused me to lose money. I would definitely not recommend this person for future projects. It is a risk I cannot afford to take again. ,1
"I had asked to do a assignment by a certain time, it was done on time but there was a problem with the work and because I didn't know the language I didn't catch it in time. This worker needs to check her work before submitting it, this was a bad outcome for me. I do not recommend worker because of the carelessness they have.",1
"This worker understood the task at hand, however they seemed to have an issue with time allocation as the ending of the document seemed to be rushed and truncated, so the project was technically incomplete. The document was not well received as the ending was not translated with care.",1
This worker provided subpar work that cause a client to greatly reduce their work with me. The worker submitted the work right at the deadline and did not even finish the translation. Since I do not speak the language I was unaware that the work was incomplete until it was handed to the client and they saw it. This worker's poor work reflected poorly on me and I will NEVER use them again.,1
The worker submitted an incomplete project very close to the deadline we had agreed on. This has caused my business monetary loss and stress and I cannot recommend them.,1
The work was clearly subpar and made me look bad at my place of employment. I wouldnt recommend their work and because of the problems it caused I would not leave positive feedback.,1
The worker used more than sufficient time (submitted work close to deadline). I was not told about the truncation issue and didn't know it since I don't know French. The worker had enough time to notice and correct. Worker takes too much time compared to the average time used.,1
My worker translation appeared truncated It appears that the system had cut of the remaining words. I didn't realize this until I was giving the essay to the client.  The incomplete essay resulted in the client having a bad impression of my work and deciding to limit the contract she has with my company.,0
"This worker did not provide a completed product.  The product was delivered just before the deadline, and it appeared to be incomplete.  I lost out on a major block of business due to this unsatisfactory product.",1
Although I appreciated the work and the availability of the person I have to admit I was a little disappointed by the end work that did. I felt the communication between me and the worker was minimal and the worker should have notified me about maybe not being able to translate or finish the work. And explained to me if they felt something was wrong with the finished product.,1
"The worker submitted at the last possible moment. Even then, the last part of the  letter was cut off. The worker is not very professional. There was no warning or communication of what was happening. ",1
"She apparently did not finish my translation, and the ending was truncated - the remainder of the essay was simply missing.   She did not advise me of this, and as a result I lost my client.",1
"The freelancer completed my project on time as promised, meeting the quick turnaround time. However, the translation was incomplete missing some key words, I'm not sure if it was because there was character limits or if it was human error. I would not rate this as high quality work. ",0
"I am disappointed that the translation was not completed completely.  There was plenty of time complete this time, but the worker did not finish the task and as a result my work was negatively impacted.  ",1
"I am willing to bet that this reviewer did indeed ""try"" to do their job but they gave a rather pitiful effort that resulted in errors which I was unable to notice as I do not speak French. This is unacceptable for someone who is hired to work as a translator. I could understand and give a pass to someone who wasn't a professional and was just doing it out of the kindness of their heart. But if your job is to translate French then you'd better do it correctly. ",1
Supposed to be fluent in English and French. Either you know the languages good enough to translate or not. Getting paid for translating means that you are good enough of a speaker/writer in both languages.,0
I was disappointed with the work that I received from this individual.  Some of the work didn't make sense to me or my customer.  The work was not complete in several ways including words that were truncated.  The last page was just cut off and my customer was very unhappy.  The worker did not deliver the paper in a timely manner.  I will not use this person again and do not recommend to others.,1
"I contact the free lancer, it was easy to reach.  The work contract was agreed upon smoothly.  however, the translator submit the work too late at the last minute, and this person seems to have missed the last few parts of the translation which affect my work, so it was negative in term of quality of work.",1
"I submitted an essay to be translated from English to French by this worker. They turned it in just before the deadline, and unfortunately, I found out later they left out the end of the article. It was like it had been cut off. This essay was going to a very important client I had at work. As a result of the worker's error, my client was left with a bad impression of me and doesn't want to do much work with my company. Avoid this translator if high quality work is important to you!",1
