The delivery person is making the best effort to make the delivery in a timely manner.They are going to the restaurant to pick up the food for a a client,0
I am upset that I can't eat what I ordered because it came with nuts. I am allergic so I cannot eat this entire order without getting violently sick and ill.,0
"They didn't bring what I ordered, plus they ignored my nut allergy. I didn't get a chance to eat lunch because of this! I will never eat at this place again. ",0
"Everything I ordered was wrong, deathly so. I ordered no peanuts as I am allergic but the meal came covered in peanuts. There is no excuse for so many errors. ",0
I was very upset and angry over the restaurant. They should take care of customer's needs and must fulfill them. They must have ask opinion with the customers. ,0
i received the meal on time however the order was completely wrong and i am allergic to nuts! what's the point of delivering something if it's completely useless!,0
"Delivery was fine, not their fault things didn't go right. But the restaurant messed up my order with no way to correct it... no lunch now, I'm allergic. Oh, well.",0
The delivery person seemed to do everything correctly. The delivery person was a capable person.He or she is only responsible for delivery the food in a timely manner.,0
The delivery person was good and get the food here on time but the food I get was not the food I order. This had peanuts and I can't eat that on top of not what I wanted,0
The person brought the food on time. Im upset that the order is wrong. They put peanut butter and they should have not. Im allergic and not I cant eat anything for lunch,0
"The delivery person was prompt, kind, and professional, however my order was wrong. This company should do a better job of double checking orders before sending them out.",0
the person that ordered the food was allergic to nuts and when ordered they gave her peanut butter and there was no money to order anything and out of time on lunch break.,0
"The meal was terrible, it was plastered with peanut butter which I am allergic to and it was missing my favorite ingredient which was the reason I oredered this exact item",0
The delivery person completed their task and job adequately and I received my order. They do not deserve blame for the significant errors made by the restaurant that prepared my food.,0
My delivery person was great. Delivered the food. The restaurant screwed up  my lunch though and I had nothing to eat or any money to get something else to eat for the rest of the day.,0
I got the food in a timely manner.  I have no problem with the delivery person.  I just wish he had checked the order before he brought it.  The order was wrong but it was not his fault.,0
"The delivery person brought my order, but it wasn't what I was expecting.  It wasn't his/her fault, but it was still a disappointing experience.  Now I'm hungry and somewhat disgruntled.",0
She was nice and courteous. It was not her fault that the restaurant messed up the order. She is just trying to get by just like the rest of us. She was patient and had a friendly smile. ,0
"This meal was prepared wrong and I could not eat it. However, I cannot blame this on the delivery person, who was just doing  their job. The delivery was the only thing that went right here.",0
"My delivery person delivered the meal promptly. I appreciated their service. Unfortunately, my meal order was all wrong. I do not think this issue had anything to do with the delivery person though.",0
This place screwed up my meal and caused me to miss lunch. They did not take into consideration my allergies (especially when this is one of the main allergies people can have). I will never go back.,0
"I have no complaints with the delivery driver. My issue was with the food itself. My order was royalty screwed up. Perhaps the driver picked up the wrong order, but more likely it is the restaurantâ€™s fault.",0
The delivery person was friendly and on time.  I have no complaints about him personally.  It wasn't his fault the restaurant massively screwed the order and I was unable to eat it due to my peanut allergy.,0
I can not blame the delivery person. But my order was all wrong. It really upset me because I couldnt eat it.  There was peanut butter on it and I am allergic to peanuts and my favorite item was not in the order.,0
 The delivery person did not check my order. My meal came with an item that I am allergic to and an ingredient that was suppose to be in the meal was not in it. I am disappointed.,1
I was at work and ordered my favorite food but this rocket scientist brought me the exact opposite so that I could not eat it AND had to get back to work so could not order again.,1
The delivery person was horrible and I do not believe they tried their hardest to get me the correct ingredients that I required. I do not think I would use this service again in the future.,1
The delivery person was slower than expected and was not as nice as she could had been. She didn't seem to enjoy delivering my food that I ordered and didnt really smile or have a nice attitude.,1
I was very disappointed that this delivery person did not realized that I have a nut allergy.  I will never order from them again.  They should be more concerned about the health of their customers.,1
The delivery person is incapable for this job.He doesn't fit for this job.He has to see what the customer has ordered clearly and then he has to bring it to the customer exactly what he or she ordered.,1
"Not sure if this was all her fault; however it would have been nice if she checked the food before she left the store. She did a good t=job, just not thorough one. A lot of blame goes back to the restaurant.",1
"The delivery person brought me my food on time, but did not get the order right. It was missing things I asked for and had things I did not ask for on it. It was not what I wanted when I ordered the food through the app.",1
"The delivery guy was courteous although he did not check that what I ordered was what I received. I think he should have been more proactive because my order was screwed up with foods I'm allergic to, and I had to go hungry because of it.",1
"I had a horrible experience! The delivery person forgot to make sure my favorite ingredient was included! Not only that, but there was peanut butter added which I am allergic to! I give this delivery person only 1 out of 5 stars, they just don't care!",1
I ordered a meal and the delivery person brought a meal that was prepared incorrectly.  I expect the delivery person to confirm that the food they're bringing me is the food that I ordered.  It's useless to pay extra for someone to bring me food I can't eat.,1
"My order was dangerously incorrect. It included items I am very allergic to and specifically asked not be included. The delivery driver did not check that this instruction was followed, and delivered my inedible meal. She should have double-checked before she left the restaurant. ",1
The delivery person got the food to me on time.  It was not their fault that the order was wrong.  The order was wrong because of the people at the restaurant.   They messed up what I was looking so forward to. The driver did all he was supposed to do and I give him  a good review for that.,1
"Unfortunately the delivery person failed to verify that my order was correct. Not only was it wrong, but it could have been deadly to me based on food allergies I have.  I feel the delivery person got paid performing a service, whereas their failure to be diligent left me with no money and no lunch.",1
THE DELIVERY PERSON BROUGHT ME MY ITEM BUT IT WAS MISSING SOME INGREDIENTS.  ALSO I REQUESTED NO PEANUT SAUCE AS I AM ALLERGIC TO PEANUTS AND IT CAME WITH PEANUTS MISSED MY LUNCH AND DO NOT HAVE TIME TO REORDER.  NOW I WILL BE HUNGRY ALL DAY.  I AM UPSET.  THE PERSON SHOULD HAVE DOUBLE CHECKED THE DELIVERY,1
"The delivery person failed to perform one of the basic functions of their job, which was ensuring the product they picked up was correct. Because of this, i was stuck without lunch for the day and i wasted money on top of it. I would only order from this person again, if they make sure the order is correct.",1
The delivery person did not check my order.  It was not what I ordered and sadly not even close.  My lunch hour was over before I got my order and it not only was wrong it was so wrong that I was alergic to ingredients on it.  Now I am unhappy and have no lunch.  I am very disappointed with this service today.,1
The delivery person didn't pay attention to the order at all. I am allergic to nuts but it had tons of peanut butter on it.  I ordered it with my favorite ingredient but it didn't have any at all.  I am wondering if this person is able to read at all.  I had to skip lunch all together.  I am not at all satisfied with the service!,1
"I ordered a meal with specific ingredients, but what i got was wasn't what i had placed as my order. I didn't want peanut butter, but there it was spread all over my meals bread. I just couldn't eat this meal, i was mad because i didn't have an option for a refund or the capability to order another meal. The delivery person should've doubled checked with me. I'm quite upset.  ",1
"The delivery person didn't bother to know the taste, likes & dislikes of the person who ordered the food. The delivery person must note down the taste, wants, preferences of the person so to avoid disappointments of clients in future. There order should be deliver within time as expected from the clients. I would rate down the delivery person due to lack of knowledge and taste of clients.",1
"The delivery person that took my order from Grubhub was not very attentive to my special dietary needs. Because of this persons innattentiveness not only was I not able to eat my lunch but could have gotten seriously ill. I cannot eat peanut butter, requested that my meal not have the peanut sauce but I still received it. I certainly am quite upset, not only did I go all day without lunch because I did not have enough cash to order something else I feel quite cheated.",1
"The delivery person did their job and delivered my meal, but they clearly did nothing to assure themselves the order was correct, as it was completely wrong and contained an ingredient I am allergic to and SPECIFICALLY REQUESTED not be added to my meal. The delivery person should care enough when receiving the order from the restaurant to verify that it is what I ordered. I will not use this service again, as it's clearly not their policy to check my order before they deliver it.",1
"Although the delivery person was fast and courteous, they did not take the time to make sure that my order was correct. The meal I ordered did not have the most important ingredient included, which was the reason I ordered that particular meal. The meal also included a large amount of peanut butter, although I specified that it should not have any peanuts since I am allergic to them. I couldn't eat the meal, and had to go without lunch. I wish this delivery person had taken the time to verify that the order was correct before delivering it. ",1
"I know the delivery person didn't cook my food, but it is their job to check orders before they go out to their deliveries, just like a waiter at a restaurant. If I were at a restaurant, I'd send the food back and it would be made right, but my delivery person made no such offers and now I am out of lunch, out of money for another, and out of time to eat, so my rumbly tummy will have to keep me company for the rest of the day. My order arrived without bananas, and slathered in peanut butter, to which I am deathly allergic. I could die from the sloppy work of my delivery person today!",1
"Driver is a piece of $#*!, kicked the smallest dog youve ever seen. Attempted to kick a second time.",1
Awful. Every time i wait an hour and a half. Won't be using again. Drivers take so long. Customer service is ok.,1
Driver never showed up. First time using service. Never again.  Now will take 3 days to get refund on my CC. Dont waste your time!!!,1
Kept getting updates that are order was delayed. The slap$#*! who delivered the order went to the wrong house. One and done with grubbhub.,1
We waited 2 hours to have food delivered. The restaurant called us after an hour to day the food had been ready but the driver never showed.,1
They wouldn't refund my meal that was never delivered because they couldn't contact their own driver... yeah. Happens more often than not with Grubhub.,1
"Pathetic place, they deliver wrong items and then abuse the customer  Grubhub does not take any action against these people.  please do not order via grubhub",1
"They forgot part of my meal and wouldn't go back and get it!  What kind of service is that?  With this level of service, I'm amazed they are still in business!",1
terrible service.  ordered and food not delivered.  can't find driver that was assigned.  put on hold for over an hour on the phone then.  still couldn't figure out what happened,1
"I have waited 3 hours for ONE MILKSHAKE. I have waited 2 hours for the wrong order. I have waited 2 hours for cold food, and for food that never came. Absolutely horrendous service.",1
It's just too unreliable. We once had a driver take our order no joke 10 times in the opposite direction of where we live and was well over 2 hours late before we had to cancel the order.,1
"We waited 2 hours for our food, and the order said it was delivered.when we called customer service they said the driver never got the order, yet it was marked as delivered. Don't wast your time with this company.",1
"The food went to the wrong hotel. I never got my food. Instead of giving me a refund, they gave me a ""credit"" for $27.11 that I have 2 weeks to use. In other words, I am going to eat the cost of that meal. Thanks?",1
"For the second day in a raw,I got my food almost after one hour and 45 min.  *cold food *missing items *not even an apology for the delay  I will never never use them and will never recommend it to anyone.stay away.",1
"Placed an order at 4:58PM. From the app (specifically, the feature where you can see the driver enroute), it appears that the driver (Lisa(?)) picked up my food, and then drive to a local casino.  I hope she enjoyed it.",1
Food takes a long time to arrive. The driver was rude and sexist. I ordered delivery and yet the driver wanted me to go find him and pick up the food. He was very condescending and got angry when I couldn't understand him.,1
"A grubhub driver damaged my car in a parking lot the damage was slight, just annoying. But not as annoying as the completely helpless response from grubhub. If they run their operations in the same fashion, I would run the other way",1
The driver claims he tried to deliver but never called nor rang the doorbell. Grunhub only offered us to return our money with no other compensation. They reached out to the driver and no response. Im deleting my account and the app.,1
"the driver went by house according to map, then drove all over the town for an hour, still no food! I chatted and texted. they apologized, gave me 5.00 coupon but still no food another hour later.. I cancelled the order after two hours.",1
Never got my food - driver claimed he couldn't find me and lost cell service...I live off of a Main Street in CT. Will NEVER use them again. In waited hours and ended up with no food. I get so angry every time I see the commercial on TV.,1
"I ordered food. It didn't arrive. I called to ask about it. They said the driver left it at the front desk of my hotel. I went to look , it was on the counter and I saw no less than 3 people look inside to see what it was. #nomoregrubhub",1
I ordered my food at 7:00 and had to cancel my order at 9:10 because the driver had problems with his car? This is a restaurant literally 15 minutes away from my house. A restaurant I might add that had the food ready at 7:30. Screw Grubhub.,1
"GrubHub, please teach your ignorant drivers how to use a call box outside of an apartment building. Find the name & press call. It is not rocket science. It defeats the purpose of DELIVERY if you have to come outside & meet the driver! Ridiculous & Ignorant.",1
we ordered our food and it said that it would be an hour so after about an hour and a half we tried to contact the company and they said it would arrive in the next 20 minutes but it never came then they tried to get into contact with the driver and we were unable.,1
"If I could, I'd give a 0. They screw up the order every time. 3 of the times they cancelled my order after making me wait 2 hours and the 3rd time the driver that was assigned to my order REFUSED to deliver my order! Customer service did nothing but give me a ""sorry""",1
The driver somehow missed half of my order when picking up then wouldn't go pick up the rest and deliver it. Missed my lunch period and wasted a bunch of time trying to get it straightened out. The only thing they offered was a half refund. This is absolutely unacceptable.,1
"Our delivery person lacked the know-how to deliver anything regarding value. The timing was way off. Please know your business before you take someone's money. Also note, if mistakes were please own up and pay up to make things right. A negative reviews is more than 1000 adds.",1
"Driver never showed up with 72.00 worth of food. They play games on the phone so don't even think calling customer service. I was told no refund, but luckily, my bank is reversing  charges. Wish I read the reviews before I downloaded the app that I deleted. Don't believe the hype.",1
All I know is $37.19 was stolen out of my bank account. Grub Hub. The telephone number went to Mexico then I was transferred to Chicago? They say they will 'investigate'? They have all the info already!! Nothing gets done. They took money out of my bank account. Theft and Fraud-Hub.,1
"The idea behind GrubHub is great, but the company itself is a total joke. We have ordered for our office MANY times and almost every time the food is later than expected and the order is ALWAYS wrong. Then we we call they don't even fix the order so some employees are left with nothing to eat.",1
"So I placed an order through Grub Hub, the driver never gave my drink & told the person I was on the phone with that she did. So basically its the drivers word over yours. Plus they didn't want to come down into the building. Don't pay tip till you get it at your door, the drivers tend to be lazy and rude.",1
"My food was left on the doorstep unknowingly for 45 minutes until I contacted customer support. When I went out I saw that birds were in it! I contacted customer support and they gave me $10 off my next order... Never again ordering from this company or their sister companies (Seamless, Eat24). #BOYCOTTGRUBHUB",1
4 times in row I have had issues with my food NOT BEING DELIVERED. Support over the phone left me on hold for more than 22 minutes just to tell me they couldnt find a manager and they would try to assign another driver because the previous one couldnt be found. DO NOT USE GRUB HUB AT ALL. WORST. SERVICE. EVER.,1
"Driver was lost when he was 5 min away,he called me and ask directions barely spoke any English , it took him 20 min and he throw out food at doorman .I tipped 20% and delivery fee.The delivery person was completely jerk. I didnt want touch the food,poor customer service and I will  never order from them again.",1
"My restaurant use their delivery service and it is horrible, never on time at least 1/2 an hour late and if a customer didn't leave a tip it will take dispatch an extra hour to find a driver, they charge 30% for bad service something need to change or UBEREATS will reap all the benefits. I will no longer use them.",1
"I received an order and the food was spilled inside the bag uneatable, so I notified grubhub, should have gotten a full refund instead got a 10.00 voucher that I used the following day at a different restaurant  turns out that restaurant doesn't deliver so I got an 8.'' refund instead   will never use this scam again",1
Food is over two hours late and not even a call from the driver. I have been a loyal grubhub customer and use them often in the past. This is unaccectable to not even call. Have been on hold for 30 minutes with customer service. Have yet to speak to a live person. Online chat is busy as well. Very bad customer service experience.,1
"I asked for paper plates, napkins, utensils, to text just before arriving because I have to use a walker. To meet me at the side (kit.) door. She gave my food to a neighbor sending near the street and drove off, and stated she already had her tip from my CC from online payment. No paper plates, napkins. Will never use Grubhub again.",1
"Had an account with them to deliver for my restaurant. Drivers or rude, non professional looking and most can hardly speak English . I spoke with account advisor several times with no solution to the problems. Door Dash is a lot better, friendlier and drivers look professional. also cheaoper to do business with and cheaper for customers.",1
"Wrong orders, always missing food, horrible customer service, takes 2 hours to get your food. Basically dont use grub hub. It would be faster to walk and you'd get what you ordered. Switching to uber eats, if they suck then I will uber my ass to the resteraunt my damn self and make sure it gets done how I want and then uber home. Good lord.",1
Twice I have used this service.  Twice I never received my orders.  Both times I was charged for them.  The drivers were to have delivered to two different addresses.  How interesting that both times they could not locate the address.  So I was told they gave the food to homeless people on the street.   Grub Hub is a scam.  Do not use them.,1
"Just ordered from Grub Hub for the first time.  It was delivered on time (by a very rude driver).  When we contacted Grub Hub via chat, it took some time for them to respond but basically said they would just refund us for the food that wasn't delivered.  No offer to deliver what they missed.  Won't even refund the delivery fee and 20% tip!!",1
"We received our food TWO HOURS late. The driver did call and state she would be there a few minutes past order time, but showed up an entire HOUR after. The restaurant receipt shows that our food was done at 5:40 and the worker arrived at 7:45. Our food was all very cold, and our ""iced tea"" was watered down without a single piece of ice. Unacceptable.",1
"I orders 1.5 hours in advance, grubhub sent an email claiming that the order was on it's way. 10 minutes later I received a call from the restaurant saying that the food was getting cold. I talked to 2 representatives from grubhub who said that they would call the driver and call me back. Neither kne ever did.    Horrible service,  liars, dont count on them!",1
Driver forgot my drink and blamed the restaurant; she told me to go back online with grubhub to deal with it. But she still got to keep her 20% tip. Grubhub also tacked on an additional fee that was not made aware to me at the time of my selection and purchase. It took them 6 days to respond to my inquiry only to blame the restaurant. I'll stick with UberEats.,1
"Do not, I repeat do not use their delivery service. They are awful. I use them today and because the driver couldn't find me my order was cancelled. When I called customer service They apologized and gave me a credit of more than what I spent, only to force me to pay out of my pocket more money because I had to order more food than I needed. Just a total nightmare.",1
"i can see why gruhub has a LOT of 1 stars; i pre-ordered at 12:30 for $87 for delivery at 6:15 for a party i was hosting.  after 2nd call to GH, they sent to driver 'ready to pickup' at 7:05!!!!!!  i didn't get my order until nearly 2-1/2 hours later!! food was cold, shocker there.   Won't ever use them again!!  everyone at my party also had bad things to say about GH.",1
"I placed an order on GrubHub for lunch.  When it arrived I realized that half of my other was missing.  Before I could catch the driver he was gone.  I called GrubHub to have the rest of my order delivered but the driver was ""unable"" to return and my 2 year old wasn't getting his lunch.  They only offered a refund which is not what I wanted.  Will never use them again.",1
Ordered food at 7:50pm estimated delivery of 8:40pm which was long for a Denny's a mile away.  Food arrived at 9:45pm an hour later than estimate.  Food was ice cold.  Found out after driver sped off I was missing one of my appetizers from the order.  Reached out to customer service and they offered a $10 coupon for my next order.  As if I would use this service again...,1
"I received my food 1.5 hours after I ordered it. The restaurant is 1.5 miles away from my work. I would have gotten my food faster if I walked. Driver was not apologetic, and customer service on the phone (when I called to inquire where my food is) was not either. When there are so many excellent food delivery companies around, I can't believe I wasted my time with this one.",1
"I ordered food and something was not delivered correctly.  That would not bother me.  But spent an hour and a half trying to get GrubHub to correct the problem at the end of which (an hour and a half later) they told me they would contact the restaurant to see if it would refund my money.  The WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE ever.  Was told a manager would call me back,  Still waiting.",1
"Orders aren't filled in order of being received. Drivers can chose which orders they want to fill and which ones they don't. We ordered Taco Bell that is 5 minutes from our house and after 2 hours and 2 times calling the company with no success, we canceled our order. They said we won't get our money back for 3-5 days. That's crooked as heck! Terrible company! Terrible Service!",1
"I don't know how GrubHub stays in business considering how often the screw up orders. This last time I ordered the driver went to the wrong address so they canceled my order because of a difference in ""mileage."" Hope the driver enjoyed eating my food! Completely ridiculous company with some of the worst customer service I have ever experienced. I've been treated better at the DMV.",1
"I've given Grubhub every opportunity. In more than a dozen orders, they have never gotten it exactly right once. Late, lost drivers, wrong orders, orders canceled after I've waited 90 minutes. And their pathetic attempts to make up for their goofs are borderline insulting. I'm out. I've placed my last order. If you want food, correct and on time, go elsewhere. These guys are the worst.",1
"I left the driver perfect instructions on how to get into the gate and they had my correct address. I missed the phone call from the driver and they left. So because the driver can't use GPS or type in a gate code correctly - Grubhub ""couln't give me a refund"" and seemed to care less about what happened.  ""Grrrreat"" customer service Grubhub. The customer is never right must be your motto.",1
"Ordered lunch at 10:15.  Delivery was for 11:15, 11:25.  By 11:50 - nothing.  App said still being prepared.  Had to chat with customer service, they called restaurant, said another 10 minutes.  15 minutes later getting a call from a driver asking if I could come get it, no parking.  Are you kidding me?  For lunch, ordered hours earlier, couldn't deliver or update - terrible.  Avoid this service.",1
"My daughter and I were home sick yesterday. She is 16. She started feeling better in the afternoon and ordered food via grubhub. The delivery was made however he started asking her inappropriate questions ...., her age, why wasnt she in school?  Thank goodness I was home and could step in however when I called Grubhub they said the delivery was from the restaurant ....  be careful in ordering food!!!!!",1
"The first time I tried Grubhub I ordered almost $40 worth of food and was delivered a tiny appetizer despite the receipt in the bag being correct, and was refunded only half the cost of my order. The drivers call my phone confused and lost every time, despite the detailed delivery instructions I provide on the website, like they haven't read it or don't know how to. Don't waste your money with Grubhub.",1
"Tried to order a pizza through Grub Hub. We never got the pizza. They goofed up our phone number. They claimed the pizza was delivered when it wasnt, then when their customer service was called for resolution, they refused to give a refund. the only thing that they would offer, was 2 separate gift certificates that could not be used together. Absolutely and Utterly ridiculous. Will never use Grub Hub EVER again.",1
"Drivers don't read or follow explicit delivery instructions. I am wheelchair-bound, so delivery instructions are critical. If food is left at the wrong place, I can't get it. Repeatedly, this has happened. Rather than get the driver back here ASAP to correct the delivery mess-up, the best Customer Service could offer was store credit. This is not satisfactory customer service. I'll never use them again... and neither should you.",1
I have never been so angry about an online order ever. This is an awful site and terrible service all together. I ordered my food and it only came to my door steps two hours later. Also there was food spilt and the food was cold. The order was completely messed up they put in all the wrong things. Cannot believe how awful this experience was. I truly wish i had read the reviews beforehand because then i would've spent my $52 elsewhere,1
"Used them two times both times  Late, wrong items ordered and cold. A winning combination. Don't use them get off your butt and get it yourself. Grubhub doesnt care about the customers or they would give some training to there subs/ delivery boys & girls. Both times the deliveries were done with people that didnt speak English. If you need some help Grubhub  I could help I run a fortune 500 company. Both times i received refund how are they making $$$$",1
"They put all the cold and hot food in 1 bag, my salad, ketchup and ranch was warm and my hot food was cold. Got a message saying it was leaving the restaurant, and would be here at a certain time, came 30 mins after it was suppose to be here. So not the restaurants fault cause I called them and they said thats how Grubhub does it, they put Hot and Cold food in the same bag and others have complained it wasnt on time. Sucky delivery method. Should have picked it up.",1
"When you pay over 50 dollars you expect to  at least receive your food. If I am a driver and they hand me a small bag from IHOP My first thought would be "" There has to be more "". It would only be common sense.  I gave a 20 percent tip for this? I will never opt in for a tip until it is deserved from now on. It seems  the driver is only concerned about their next order and not the one they are currently on.  I would add a photo of the food except I never received it.",1
"If I could give a negative number I would. The restaurant we ordered from is 0.4 miles from our house.   The food was cold & took nearly 25 minutes to get here. The driver was so rude. She called & wouldn't even speak with me. She hung up on me. FYI, my name was on the credit card & the phone she called. My son was outside waiting for the delivery.  I called the 800 number to complain, he was a useful as a box of rocks in quarry.  I wouldn't ever recommend GrubHub to anyone I know.",1
"I placed a schedule delivery for 9:15pm around 7pm and my order my never picked up from the restaurant. I called Grub Hub customer service and they stated that 5 drivers rejected the order probably because I didnt put a tip on the order. I told them that I give cash as a tip. I was told that they will try and find another driver and its already 10pm, restaurant is closed. So basically Grub Hub had to cancel my order. There should be an option to choose cash a tip. Horrible service!",1
This service is probally the worst there is. I ordered food 4 miles from my house and took an hour and a half. The driver had it in his car for almost an hour. When I called to find out what was going on I was constantly put on hold. When I asked for a supervisor I was told I could leave my number and get a call back in 24 hours or wait on the line for 5-10 minutes to speak to one. When I did speak to one there was no apology and she did not follow through on her promise. I would suggest Uber eats.,1
Nothing but a headache! Placed the order which was said tone delivered 20-30 minutes later. Received 2 notices of delays without explanation. After an hour called the restaurant and food had been ready for over 30 minutes but no driver pick up. Grubhub tried to blame the restaurant on the 3 call and promised delivery within another 15 minutes. Desert was made 9o minutes from ordering and it was wrong plus drinks missing. First and last order with them. Don't use them; business model doesn't work. Money wasted.,1
"Order was extremely late, never got a call it was on its way. Order was wrong, and we didn't get what we wanted. Called to get it figured out. Took over an hour on the phone to get it straightened out. They agreed to send a driver out to get our new food! Hours went by and we never got any food. Called them up again and customer service didn't do $#*! for us, even the second time around!  Never going back, don't give this junky site your business, they don't deserve another penny of your money!  Sincerely,  Disappointed",1
"I placed an order for our firm at 9:37 a.m. for a noon delivery. The order was ready at the restaurant at 11:50 a.m. and waiting for the driver. At 11:15, the order was still ready at the restaurant and waiting for the driver. I called GrubHub and they called the driver. They said she was very rude to them and they were really sorry - she was leaving the restaurant right then. My order place at 9:37 a.m. for noon delivery, arrived at 12:30. Grub Hub offered a $10 coupon for $60 worth of food to arrive late and only warm.",1
"Three times I've tried this service and three times I've been disappointed (in two different states so I can't blame the area that we're in). Twice my order has been so late that it was cold, soggy, and inedible and ultimately refunded by GrubHub. The restaurants have all be fine to work with (one actually called to let me know that the order had been waiting on the driver so long the kitchen decided to remake it) but the delivery drivers and the customer service staff are useless. I won't be giving them a fourth chance.",1
We place an order through Grub Hub and after more than an hour late and many phone calls to the restaurant we learned that the food was ready a half hour before but the Grub Hub driver hadn't shown up and never did. When we called Grub Hub to find out what was going on they HUNG UP on us. In the end we went and picked up our own food at the restaurant. If I owned a restaurant I'd hire my own drivers and FIRE Grub Hub. We will NEVER order through Grub Hub again after this experience. It's true: it doesn't get any worse than this!,1
"I GrubHub drivers calling me and when I don't answer they just leave with my food. Or, they call and then when they get to my front porch they bang with their fist on my door and ring the doorbell repeatedly. All I get from GrubHub when I call to complain is that I should put something in special instructions. But, that never works because no one reads it, apparently. There's another service in my town, although they charge a lot for delivery. But GrubHub is not worth the aggravation. And, they treat their employees lousy as well.",1
"They tried to get me into it after they acquired eat24. I actually really liked eat24...Well, they don't deliver on time and many times they don't even deliver your food. I've had horrible experiences raging from food taking 4 hours to deliver from 4 blocks away from me, to restaurants that give me food poisoning, drivers delivering only part of my items, to food that never arrives (x3). Why do I keep using it? Because they have restaurants that don't get delivered by doordash or postmates. Lately, I've been wondering it its worth it",1
"I have been very sick this week so my husband used them an hour ago to get us food from Hooters so we wouldnt have to leave the house. It took over an hour to get our food. The food was cold , we were missing several items, and when we called grub hub back they told us that they would not go pick it back but refund the money. I called the restaurant and told the lady what I was missing. The lady informed me that she did in fact put those missing items in my bag. Not sure who is to blame but I will NEVER use this horrible company again",1
The delivery driver calls waits for 5 minutes and then drives away. He did not come to the door and that's what I was waiting for. Isn't that apart of their job? I tried calling back to get customer service and their just as worse. Saying there's no way to give me my money back nor can they get in contact with the driver that just left with my order. When I finally tell the guy let me speak to a manager he then offers me a refund. It took 20 mins on the phone just to get a refund and it's going to take 3-5 business days not including the weekend (it's a Friday),1
"I find it disturbing that I am a loyal Grubhub customer and waited from an order placed at 6:15pm-7:41pm and still never received it the driver told customer service they dropped my order off at the office... there is no office I live in a house which means they took it to another house In my neighborhood, I think that's very very unprofessional. I deserve something more than a refund I am a pregnant mother of 2 who is on bed rest and relied on Grubhub to follow through with my order. I honestly feel like the driver ate my order. Smh  On Dec 12, 2018, at 7:41 PM",1
We ordered fast food from Chick-Fil-A. The driver arrived a hour and a half late. Our food was ice cold. When I called the Grubhub customer service line to complain I was offered a credit. It was obviously a lie as it has not appeared. None of this was Chick-fil-A's fault. It was all the worst EVER Grubhub service from the driver to whoever answers their customer service line. What a ridiculous encounter for a fast food place!!! We haven't ordered since. I'm not sure we will. I'm starting to realize this company doesn't care about their customers only the almighty dollar.,1
"We ordered from a local restaurant and the delivery time was approx. 45 min. to 1 hr. After checking the email receipt and clicking on ""Track Order"" we discovered the delivery time had been pushed up to 1hr 45 min to 2 hrs. We called the restaurant and were told the order was ready, GrubHub had been notified but their driver had never shown up. We called GrubHub and found they hadn't a clue what the situation was so we canceled the order and ate something else.  At least they canceled and refunded quickly, they must have had a lot of practice. We will NEVER use GrubHub again.",1
"I waited 3 hours for my order. Support Services game me a coupon for ""next time"" like there will be one. When the delivery man got here he was trying to ask what my apartment was hung up on me as I was telling him. (Keep in mind the order already has my address and apartment number on it) It was a simple sub from a fire house subs 6 minute drive a few blocks away. They messed up my order I simply asked for no tomatoes on the extra comments section for the order. I was really sick I could barely walk yet alone go driving. I figured i'd try an ordering service HORRIBLE experience.",1
"I have had at least 7 incorrect orders, 5 deliveries of cold food, and 9 deliveries that were 45 minutes or more past the projected delivery time. The drivers are lazy thugs. They all wear bedroom slippers and act like they are doing you a favor. Twice they walked away before I had hold of the bag while they turned to walk away talking on their phone. Food hit the pavement. Get your ass off the couch (if you can) and DO NOT PAY THESE FOOLS. Hell, I live in the ATL and one of these MOFO's is up for murder right now for shooting an unarmed Customer. Check the news in ATL 12/2018. 4 real.",1
I well never order from GrubHub again I never got my order or a refund I spent $53 on food I never got we waited for about a hour and called them they said the food should be here any minute 30 minutes go by so we received a text message that or food was delivered at 815pm but we never got the food so we called them back and they put us on hold for about 15 minutes they come back on the phone and tell us the driver went home for the night and we could not get a refund because the driver called us 3 time's and was outside we never got or food and can't get or money back im so mad and will never use GrubHub again,1
"Place order at 10:30am for a 12:15pm delivery.  Tracker said order was delivered at 12:04.  It was not.  Checked with IHOP and they stated that the order was picked up at 12:02pm.  Spent 30 minutes on live chat - and got no answer as they ""were trying to locate the driver.""  Called Live customer service.  Another 10 minutes on the phone.  Unable to reach driver.  Asked for a refund!!! As a diabetic eating at scheduled times is critical.  Wasted my entire lunch break track food I never got.  My blood sugars dropped to 59.  A friend ran and got me a coke and gave me a banana That she had not eaten.  Let's see if they issue refund!",1
I have been ordering with grubhub for years all over the country for work and personal. Tonight I started  ordering dinner at 615pm and at 710 the delivery driver brought me someone elses little order and I was feeding my whole sick family after working all day. Called them asap and by the time they got the restaurant said it was too late cause restaurant was closing in 20. Refunded my pay and gave me credit. So. I ordered from another restaurant and 70 minutes later they cancelled my order and not only did they only give me a $5 credit but by 940pm all restaurants were closed and I couldtn even order pizza.. will never use them again,1
Twice in one week!! I was hopeful I would get good service.  The driver took 45 minutes to drive 1 mile and called to ask me to meet them. Hmm - I paid for a delivery fee and tip! When I told them where to park they took an extra 15 minutes. So GrubHub gave me a $5.00 coupon. Tried again today.  Driver actually came to my office but after a 45 minute drive the food was cold and she brought the wrong food.  I let GrubHub know - they blamed the restaurant - and then said they would issue a refund for the missing food.  They do issue a refund - less the $5.00 coupon I used for previous bad service.  They can't seem to get their act together.  BUH-BYE Grubby GrubHub!,1
"Tried to use this app last week while on vacation in Las Vegas. Tracker told me my order was delivered only it wasn't. The driver told me it ""wasn't her problem"" and hung up on me. Really? Whose problem was it? Mine? No. I contacted grubhub directly and asked for a refund and was told they don't do that and could only give me a discount code even though I live in small town Idaho where Grubhub doesn't even exist, not that I'd use it again anyway. I just think a refund for a pretty expensive order that was never delivered should be an option and it's bs that it's not and that I was treated so rudely by the driver. Denise in Las Vegas should look for a different job. Awful experience.",1
"So my first use of grub hub was about 2 years ago and my food took over two hours to get to my location and the food was cold by then and not worth the money. So giving this food delivery site another chance about 4 months after the first time I ordered from Grub Hub I tried again. Once again it took forever to get food that arrived warm this time but since it took so long I did not give the driver a tip, and he was upset. So with me wanting to give this site a third chance I tried again a few months ago. And once again I was let down by very expensive prices to deliver food that shows up way late and barley warm. So Im officially done with Grub Hub, have them three chances and that was enough.",1
"I personally don't like nor do I trust using apps for food delivery; do the traditional way with calling the restaurant directly or pick up take out at the location. One of GrubHub's drivers never made it to the restaurant my husband and I ordered from, made us wait for over two hours: during that time my husband called the restaurant regarding our order, and then the driver claimed/updated the app that our food was delivered when it wasn't. My husband then called GrubHub and explained our situation and all we got was our money refunded. Personally I think after that situation we're owed a free meal paid by GrubHub, but I'd rather leave this review and spread the world to NEVER use this app or do business with GrubHub.",1
My food was an hour+ late the kid showed up stoned out of his mind. I'm pretty sure he picked up my food then when and got baked hence being so late.  The queso had been dumped all over my chips and due to being so late the chips were all soggy. the food was cold and the driver didn't even apologize just stared at me like he was expecting a cash tip which i paid with card so unfortunately I tipped him anyways which I wouldn't have. And all I got for almost a 30$ meal was a 5$ off coupon for food I didn't get to enjoy at all. In fact I ended up having to go get something to eat from the gas station. Not only will I not suggest GrubHub I will not be using it again this was the worst experience I have ever had with a delivery.,1
I am mother of a very active toddler . I work long hours and dont have time to come home and cook. I decided to trust my gut and order from food to be delivered from Grubhub. I placed my order and waited two hours  for my food. Come to find out the driver lied about delivering my food and I told the customer service team . I asked if they track their drivers they claim they do not they dont . I called the restaurant to see if anyone came but they never showed and my food sat there. I managed to scream my way to a refund . And the restaurant also said I had to pay in person for my food if I wanted it. So lesson learned Grubhub is the worst company around for food deliveries . I will never use their services again and I hope there corporate office gets this,1
"Delivery driver claimed to have attempted to make a delivery, he said the business looked closed. We are located in a building with several other businesses with a big sign that says our hours and to knock. Come to find out, the driver's for Grub Hub get to keep the food if it's not delivered! So why would they put forth effort to locate your business??   After this I called to get a refund, they told me they would email me with the coupon codes. Never received email. Called again to just refund my card and say forget it, they then said only credits can be issues since we missed the delivery...this delivery service ( I use that term loosely) is a joke! If we're going to be screwed over, we at least want to feel it!!!!!!!!!! We'll stick with Bite Squad from now on.",1
"Normally I would never right a review like this however Grubhub was so incompetent tonight that it boggles the mind. After I placed an order at 9 I received an email at 11:45 (an hour past expected delivery). It revealed not only was my order canceled BY GRUBHUB, not only were all of the restraunts in the area closed, BUT IN 3 HOURS A DRIVER NEVER PICKED UP THE ORDER. IT TOOK THEM 3 HOURS TO TELL ME THIS. I am litterally so  hungry RN and cant get food because this took so long. The worst thing is that I might view this as a one time issue except for the fact that THIS EXACT SAME THING HAS HAPPENED TWICE BEFORE.  A 5 dollar discount which expires in two months i not enough. I litterally did not eat tonight because of this companies incompitance and I am deleting the app.",1
I placed an order for pizza to be delivered to my daughters birthday party. I received email confirmation of delivery.  When I called the restaurant to confirm they did not have the order and told me the order would not be prepared in time. I had to re order and the driver was 45min. late  we had to go to a different restaurant to get pizza before the kids left the party. I received an email from grubhub stating it was their fault they did not send the order tot he restaurant and offered me a $10 gift card.  I had over $100 in pizza ordered they admitted to screwing up - no apology only a $10 gift card for my inconvenience.  Not worth the stress and hassle - call the restaurant  directly much easier.    Grubhub - great idea HORRIBLE business  and even worst customer service.,1
"I ordered from this site many times, even after they screwed up.  I was new to on;line delivery, and I was trying to be nice, and give them a chance to get their act together.  But they never did!  Each time, they got worse and worse, until I finally gave up on them.  Delivery was dog slow nearly every time.  The delivery people didn't speak English very well, and they would argue with you when you complained.  That didn't even do any good, because you couldn't understand half of what they were saying!  The first few times, the driver got lost, and I had to go online to a chat agent to correct the situation.  That even took time, because they were always busy with other customers.  I don't know who runs this company, but someone there needs a swift kick in the rear end!  These people are awful!",1
"I placed an order an hour prior to me taking my lunch at work. It was 12:15 p.m. The expected arrival time was 1:00 -1:10 p.m. I check around 1:00 p.m. on my order to see if it was on its way, and the order showed delivered!! I called GrubHub and the woman checked on the order for me, she could not locate the driver so I waited on the line and finally at 1:25 she said that she could not locate the driver, so she asked if I wanted to send another driver. I was about to hit my 6 hours at work and had to take my lunch asap so I told her I would pick the food up, and all she said was ""ok"" and hung up. I am not the type of person to ask for free meals or anything because I know what it is like to work in customer service, but I know when to offer a customer something when they have received very poor service!!",1
"I ordered dinner for myself while working at a motel. I put in the correct address for delivery (as I have done several times before without incident). Work got busy for a few minutes, and I was unable to check my phone. Within a 10 minute span, I had three missed calls and a missed text from Grub Hub, informing me that the driver was attempting to get a hold of me. Ok, thanks! So I called the customer service line to get in touch with my driver. They tell me the driver couldn't wait any longer so he left, and I was not entitled to a refund. I never saw a driver or person approach the lobby, so apparently this person tried to call, couldn't get through, and instead of coming up to the damn door of the address that was listed on the order, decided to just bail and, I guess, what, throw my food away? Sweet dude",1
"Yikes! This service is iffy.  Please use only when you've been drinking and cannot drive to pick up your own fast food.   Unfortunately the wait times are extremely long and the drivers are aggressive and apparently without proper gps?! (It took mine a 10 minute phone conversation & 35 minutes over the maximum expected delivery time to find me?!... I live in a very city-central location).   Called with my complaint (cold & late food that added onto my cell bill). The employee was great- very professional, kind and accommodating .. only reason I'm not trying to give this 0 stars!  Ordered again (2nd times' a charm?!) ... 2 hour wait from 3.4 miles away... I could literally walk and get my food in that time.   Done with this service. Please do not try to finangle this if your ordering lunch while at work..  ... you will not receive it in time.",1
"Customer service sucks, and the drivers don't care at all about your food (and in some cases, incomplete dinners were because the driver helped himself to some of it).  It is always unreasonably late, usually spilled or otherwise turned upside-down (one idiot driver actually took out a box from the bag that he had put in upside down, turned it right side up and handed it to me like it was no big deal).  I called grubhub and all they do is give you $5 off your next order.  I've gotten this same nonsense enough that I won't be spending that $5 credit through grubhub - it was a great idea, but their service and their drivers absolutely suck.  I always tipped very well (and paid up front when I paid for the food - not when it arrived, or I'd have ended up just handing out pennies and advice), and no matter what, the drivers just got worse and worse.",1
"After waiting for an hour, I called Jack in the Box to ask if my order was on it way. The woman said the order was ready, but that there wasn't a driver to deliver it. I waited for 10 minutes before I contacted customer service, only to waist 30 minutes on the line without reaching a customer service representative. I got frustrated and wanted to cancel the order, but I couldn't. I called my bank to see if I could cancel the order, but they said they couldn't. I spent 10 minutes searching on the web to see if there was a way to cancel the order. I finally called the restaurant again. The woman told me a driver had finally picked up the order, but that he wasn't pleasant. 15 minutes later, I received a ""Delivered"" confirmation. I got nothing. I am now on the phone trying to reach customer service. 10 mins later, and no answer. Do yourself a favor and delete this app.",1
"1. Order delivery time kept getting delayed.  2. Finally called restaurant, the order had been sitting ready for pickup for 25 minutes  3. The driver, Raida, then marks the order as delivered before it even arrived to me.  4. The burger and fries were room temp. Not even warm. Not the restaurant's fault  GrubHub kept pushing out the delivery window.  5. I first contacted customer service via chat with Omid. After explaining what happened, his only response was it arrived in the delivery window. He did not acknowledge that the delivery window kept getting pushed out by GrubHub, not the restaurant, and the dishonesty of the driver.  6. I then called Erickson, who was very courteous and offered to pass along the feedback and sent this coupon. Erickson was the only good part of my experience with GrubHub.  I will not use GrubHub and will recommend others to avoid as well.",1
"GrubHub is the worst. Ordered food from them, to find out an hour later that driver never made it on time and restaurant closed. Ok. No biggie. Just was trying to look for something else when restaurant called me that driver is finally there. Called GrubHub and begged them to please ask the driver to take that food and bring it to me. Driver never did. They said my order got cancel and driver have a right not to take it. So they gave me a ""free"" grub after this. Ok. Me after 2 hours of trying to eat-looking for something to spend that ""free"" code. But operantly their ""free"" is not free. Promo code only covers the food part but the taxes and delivery fee had to come from my packet. After everything I've been through last night-I just ordered Postmates. Finally ate my dinner 3 hours later. Never again. Grab hub can eat their ""free"" promo code. Disrespectful, awful customer service",1
"I've been waiting for two hours for food from a restaurant that is 10 minutes away. The last 3 times I've used GH it was the same thing. It always estimates delivery time in about an hour and a half, but then keeps pushing back the delivery time in twenty minute intervals. I have to call the restaurant every time and they always say, Oh its on it's way right now. There currently isn't any incentive to use this delivery service. There's a fee to use it, plus you have to tip the drivers, even though this driver is now an hour late, and they make you pay with credit card; you can't use cash. I could've walked to and from this restaurant by now. If I had known it would take two hours, I would've made other arrangements.   JUST received a call as I was typing this review saying that my order has been canceled because they couldn't find a delivery driver. JUST now telling me this. It's almost 11pm.   Do yourself a favor and don't use GH.",1
"Recently tried Grubhub in Greenville , SC. First try was Red Lobster and the order was missing sauces and was cold. We only live 15 minutes away. Grubhub support did nothing. Tried Ruby Tuesdays and the driver left a salad and all the sauces at the restaurant. Support line took 15 minutes to let me know they would contact the restaurant for a partial refund and unlike other services never offered to have a driver bring it. Like an idiot I tried for my last time. Ordered from Denny's and received confirmation but tracking never showed on app. Support once again was slow and none caring. 20 minutes later they said all was well and I would get the order in 30 minutes. The app now showed progress only to have it switch to cancelled 20 minutes later. No one ever explained why it was cancelled. They need better customer service, moving support back to the US may help cut the support time. Actually caring and appreciating customers would be another.",1
"Wednesday Night (10/11/17) I ordered food from a restaurant at 4:45 PM. I received a call from GrubHub at 5:45 (about 10 minutes after the original expected delivery time) and was told a driver had ""accidentally"" cleared the order, and that it was placed again, and I should receive my order by 6:15. I understand that accidents happen, so I didn't make a fuss about it.  However, 7:15  rolls around and I STILL do not have my food. I messaged them on their ""online chat"" and was told that someone was on their way with my food, and that it would be there shortly. I was also told that I'd be credited ""$10"". I waited until almost 8:00 and called again, only to be hung up. My driver FINALLY arrived at 8:25, and said she didn't even receive an alert of the order until 7:45. My pizza was ICE cold, and my salad was soggy.  I have never had an issue with them before this, but after waiting almost 4 HOURS for my food, I will not use them again. I am very disappointed in their lack of care or service.",1
"I thought I would try this door delivery and choose Grubhub.  I ordered with side sauces and salad dressing on side.  It arrived pretty fast and no wonder cuz the driver did not bother to check order for side sauces. I call Crack Shack they told me to call Grubhub.  I told him my salad was a hot one and by the time your driver brought dressing it would be cold.  He informed me ""Oh we won""t be sending anyone"".  The guy at Grubhub told me he had to check and call back.  When he called he said ""Well for the salad we will credit you back and for the dipping sauces for chicken we will give you 5.00 off next order"".  I laughed and said do you really think I will order again, that is a big NO!  And I already had a 5.00 off my next order because It was my first time.   So this is crap.  He was a jerk and how hard is it to check the order you are delivering!  No rocket Science.  These guys are the worst.  I drove for Postmates when they first started so I know the routine.  These guys were just bad all around.",1
"After waiting over an hour for nothing more than soup and salad, the driver NEVER SET FOOT out of his car. Instead, he called my phone(mind you my delivery instructions specifically state to RING BELL 1B) which for whatever reason didn't ring. The phone did buzz, but it was a text saying we are trying to deliver your order and can't reach you. I then go outside, see a car with hazards on and I'm yelling like an idiot from my doorway because I thought he would be outside the door. Instead, the car pulls away. Mind you, there is a very bright light over my door and giant letters with the address and a bell CLEARLY LABELED. It is a clear night, no rain and NO REASON WHATSOEVER to stay in your car instead of getting out and LOOKING with little effort for the address. What's worse than this???? A 10 minute wait for GrubHubs supposedly GREAT customer service over the phone only to have someone answer and HANG UP. People, get a clue, order from the restaurant and skip this horrible service or USE ANOTHER SERVICE.",1
"My driver arrived with one small bag and I knew right away that this was not my complete order. I looked inside and sure enough, it was only half of a very large order. I let him know right away and he explained (not so nicely) that it was against policy to drive back to the restaurant. I called customer service and sure enough, that IS their policy! The first person I spoke with over the phone insisted that *I* call the restaurant and go pick up the order myself! I hung up and called the next person and she also said their policy is to NOT check the bags to make sure an order is complete before leaving the restaurant, and they do NOT ever go back to re-deliver...but that if I really needed my order, that I can call the restaurant and go pick it up myself. Um...isn't that why I just paid you a whole bunch of money to deliver it?? Not only will they NOT refund you, they refuse to refund the delivery charge!!! Bad, bad business practice. Oh, but wait, they sent me a $5 off my next order of $20 or more coupon! Never again.",1
"We placed an order for Sushi at 2:45pm.  Delivery was out to arrive at our place at 3:40.  When I checked the status of my delivery at 3:45 via the ""Track Delivery"" option, the driver indicated she had delivered our food.  Instantly, I called customer service and spoke with a woman who did not understand English very well and was clearly reading from a screen.  She placed me on hold while she contacted the driver.  This took over 45 minutes.  Finally, she said the driver ""found the order in her car and will deliver it ASAP"".  NOOOOO, I don't want sushi that has been sitting in the car for over an hour.  And what was this ""she found it"".... why did she say it was delivered??? After another hour of going back and forth attempting to speak to a supervisor the deliverer came to our building attempting to deliver the food.  Of course we refused and requested a refund.  After another 45 minutes of talking with several individuals who were supposedly supervisors, we were connected with a kind gentleman who was apologetic.  We were on the phone for an entire 2 hours to get a mere refund.  Never again!",1
"Busy day at the office so I order some Indian food.  They say it will be here around 12:45.  Great.  At 1:00 I start thinking wow where is my food, I'm starving!  I track my order on the Grub Hub site, and wow it says it was delivered at 12:28.  I go up to the reception desk, nope, not there.  Receptionist calls down to the building lobby, no not there.  I call Grub Hub and she informs me that the driver tried calling my cell at 12:30 and because he didn't reach me (because, you know, I was busy at work) he decided not to deliver the order.  Because the point of ordering online and giving them my address to a building they can walk into and deliver stuff to is to make things MORE complicated and LESS convenient.   Oh, and they won't refund the money.  So I ask to talk to a supervisor and I'm currently on hold (it is now 1:20) and holding, and holding and holding.  I guess they don't want me talking to a supervisor.  So I'm leaving this review as well as reviews on every review site I can find and I'm disputing the transaction with my credit card.  Grub Hub gets a big middle finger for this one.",1
"I had such a horrible my experience on my most recent order and my last. I had conflicting information where one site said my order was still being made and another one saying it would be delivered over half an hour late. I used the chat to find out status and that was a joke!  After the person took an eternity checking into the status they told me the driver delivered my food to someone else. That was it. Not an I'm sorry (not until the very end), not a ""we're having it made again and will deliver it as soon as possible"", nothing. I was left an hour and a half after I ordered to figure out what I was now going to do for dinner for my family. And the chat person was useless. I thought bite squad was bad but this was the worst experience ever. I can never take this risk again so I cannot use GrubHub ever again. It's such a shame because I really don't like bite squad because they lie to their customers and I have proof of that. I guess I just go back to never ordering food online again.  And they had the nerve to send me a $10 credit. Seriously? $10 makes up for not having dinner for my family? NOT!",1
"0 Stars! I recently had ankle surgery and thought Grubhub would help my dilemma of getting food without having to venture out on crutches. I am so frustrated I couldn't take it any longer. I have placed 45 orders in just over 3 months. More than 2/3 of the orders have something wrong with them because of how they are handled by the drivers. They consistently throw the food around their cars, don't read the order notes, and shove the food at you when you arrive. The final straw was receiving my pizza and soup from CPK today that was stuffed sideways into their red delivery bags. The delivery guy was being driven around by someone else and spoke no English. He approached my door and opened the bag to have me remove it for him (most likely because he was afraid of the spilled food inside"" and looked at me like oh well when I questioned how is was being carried. The customer service rep sounded like a robot with repeating ""sorry for the inconvenience"" a hundred times and had no real care about the point I was making about the type of people that are working for them and representing them. Stay away like the plague!",1
"We placed an order through GrubHub for the KFC on Crater Road in Petersburg, VA because it is so close to us.  Not only was our order more than a half-hour late, but it was also incorrect. Instead of the 2 Diet Pepsi drinks I ordered, we received 1 regular Sprite-type beverage, which was definitely not good for my diabetic husband. Our chicken was wrong, and our sides were wrong or missing as well. In addition, our dessert order was non-existent. The driver was useless as far as customer service, as were the customer service people to whom I spoke on the phone. They were to replace and redeliver my order, but then they sent an email message refusing to do so, claiming that a restaurant that closes at 10 p.m. was closed at 8:02 p.m. This was completely unacceptable, and the only way to have satisfactorily fixed it was to have delivered our original order promptly and correctly, which they refused to do. They had plenty of time to have fixed it during the whole time period of this experience, yet they refused and resorted to lying about it. The fault lies with both KFC and GrubHub, and both had absolutely horrible customer service.",1
"This is the second time I have tried to order food with GrubHub. Both experiences were horrible to say the least. The first time the restaurant actually called me to see if I wanted to pick up the order myself because the driver never arrived. This time, my order delivery time got backed up 20 minutes because of the driver and they only delivered half of the order.   When I asked where the chips and drinks were the delivery person said I did not order them, even though the store had called to ask what chips I wanted since they did not have the kind I ordered. After fighting with me about if I actually ordered them or not she pulls out her phone and said look it just says sandwich. Guess what word was right next to the sandwich? COMBO! Sent her back to get the rest of my order. 25 minutes later she shows up with 3 bags of chips and 3 drinks that are watered down and half empty! I contacted Grubhub and they did not seem all too concerned about it. Basically a ""sorry about your luck"" attitude. DO NOT USE GRUBHUB! Any businesses out there considering using them for delivery - DON'T DO IT!! They will give you a bad reputation. I would give them a 0 if I could.",1
"This is how I found out that Grub Hub isn't a customer focused company. I ordered a dozen glazed kreme filled doughnuts from Krispy Kreme via Grub Hub. My contract is with Grub Hub at that point, not the restaurant. Yet when I recieved my food, late I might add. The doughnuts looked like they had been put through the ringer and four of the doughnuts didn't have any kreme in them at all. I  chatted with Grub Hub, spoke with two different agents and neither could get me a refund, this is after I provided picture proof as well. They said Krispy Kreme didn't want to give me my money back for not properly ensuring I got what I ordered. All they could offer is a dozen free doughnuts. Never mind the fact that we pay extra to get the food delivered to our door. Grub Hub said they couldn't offer a refund either with out the Restaurants approval. So when you do business with Grub Hub they're not guaranteeing you'll receive good service from the vendor you choose. They're not backing up their service with any type of refund policy for faulty orders. If the Restaurant says no, you're screwed. I'll never use them again and I'll never buy a Krispy Kreme doughnut as long as I live.",1
"First (and likely last) experience using GrubHub.  The delivery driver failed to reach me on my cell (he was 30 minutes ahead of schedule and so I did not have my phone on me); unfortunately, rather than walking up to door to deliver food (side note: I live in a standalone single family residence in a family-friendly neighborhood), he simply left.  When I called GrubHub to report the missing delivery, the rep was unable to reach the driver and offered to re-order my meal for a re-delivery.  Thirty minutes later, the restaurant called me directly to see if GrubHub was sending another driver to claim the order.  Confused that the rep hadn't dispatched another driver, I called GrubHub back to request a driver to pick up the ready food and was informed by another rep that they ""don't do that."" And nothing else -- no research to figure out the previous rep who assisted me to clarify what happened, no additional solution or assistance or offer to refund my money, nothing -- just awkward silence on their end of the phone.  Terrible customer service experience, and much more hassle than if I had just driven out to the restaurant -- which I ended up having to do anyway to feed my house full of guests.",1
"Order was late, completely wrong..completely wrong entrees AND missing items. The driver..umm not healthy we will say. Called and said ""I'm *** and I'm on my way with your food."" Took him 30 minutes to drive 1.5 miles apparently at 11:30 at night with no traffic. Husband drove the food back to Applebees (took my husband literally 3 minutes) . The guy that packed the food at Applebees was argumentative. The manager,however, was great and we actually felt bad for him. Clearly GrubHub is a huge problem for them and they are losing money hand over fist because of this shady company. Grub Hub...said they would ""figure out"" (when I said we were just returning the food their driver wouldn't) ""if they were going to do anything for us."" Not kidding. Quote. She put me on indefinite hold, hung up and never called back. So, they kept our $11 bucks for their service and we didn't demand a refund from Applebees because the manager tried real hard to make it right and clearly has suffered tremendous losses because of this sham company. This was my second and final try with GrubHub and companies like them. Yes, the first time was a disaster too as they sold us food for a restaurant that was closed for business.",1
"The foodler/GrubHub merger has been a disaster! Foodler never had such problems. The GH customer service can be great when the numerous problems pop up, but this week, it just took a nose-dive. Items left off of orders, surly drivers, fighting with and through GH customer service to get corrections made, promises of refunds lagging when they hadn't previously, courtesy discounts to compensate this regular customer for the overall bad night of service promised but not made good on. Even when I called to follow-up, it still did not reflect the promised email evidencing the courtesy discount, on top of the meager refund for the kid's meal that had missing items. By the time I fought them and got the items and promised refund and discount, (the latter verbally) I was spent and lost my appetite. It was like I went hunting and prepared and cooked my own food, which is not the point of ordering this expensive food. This is becoming an abomination that will have me looking for another food service. Too many days of bad food and/or service, with this week being the absolute worst. If you make a promise GH, keep it! Don't? That is called bad faith or worse, just bad business. I need to cut you off like a bad ex.",1
"I've used Grubhub since 2013. I've used it so often - especially from last year to this year. I order from it everyday, sometimes twice a day. And recently, I've specifically written in the ""additional instructions"" to come meet me at the parking garage. Some drivers have called me in the past to ask me if I could meet them at the front door instead, and in those cases, I went to the front door without any trouble. But today, this driver Amanda doesn't even call me and sends me a sing text saying ""I'm here with your food."" So I go to the parking garage, search for her, and then call her. She says she doesn't want to come to the garage. I tell her that because I did not bring my keys, I would have to go all the way up to 5th floor to get my keys and go back out to the front door if she didn't come to the garage. She still says she's not comfortable coming to the garage. So we hang up and she leaves with my food.   What a terrible service to a regular customer. Can't believe this is how they treat their top customers? I am pretty sure that I'm one of the customers that use Grubhub most often, and why am I getting this $#*!ty service? I am not taking the food, so take that 20 bucks. And I am never ordering from Grubhub again.",1
I was staying I had a hotel close by and thought I would order through GrubHub and I ordered from the treat restaurant a pizza and I added some fries with gravy because you need to do a minimum of $15 to get the discount on your first order.  About 15 minutes before my order was supposed to arrive I put my dogs away in a crate so they wouldnt bark when the guy came to the door. Sometimes people arrive early and I expected that might happen they gave a 10 minute window of the delivery time I waited and waited nobody ever showed up I had the dogs in their crate for over 40 minutes   Finally the guy called over a half hour late and I could barely understand his English. He was at the hotel walking around. That didnt make sense because its cold outside and why do you want to walk around with the food. When you want to take your car and drive to the room with the X ternal entrance?. He gave me the food and I thanked him he didnt apologize for being 30 minutes late I had no idea the food was cold once I was back in my room the pizza was freezing cold and the fries were cold too and fries with gravy are gross when theyre cold.  He didnt give me any plates or anything like that so I cant heat up the pizza in my hotel room  I dont think Ill ever order from them again,1
"Well, I have just had my second worst experience ordering from Grub Hub.  My first was a couple months ago when after 2 and a half hours I still did not receive my food.  I called Moe's and was told their tablet was down and they never received my order.  This time my delivery driver did not deliver my food because there was no parking on the street.  The food was not even returned to the store.  After multiple calls to Grub Hub who already had my money, they refunded $35.00 of my $35.68 order in the form of two promo emails.  One for $25.00 and the second for $10.00 which that I could use on a future order stating that since the driver attempted deliver they could not refund my money.  WHAT??? So I attempted to place my order again and when I went to check out, Grub Hub would only allow me to use one of the two promo codes which caused me to pay even more money for my food.  The restaurant called me upon receipt of my second order to ask if I received my food.  Nope.  I explained what happened and was informed that the driver never returned the food to them or let them know there was a problem with the delivery.  I also had a issue with Grub Hub a couple of weeks ago when their driver called and stated there was no parking and I needed to come outside and down the block to get my food from their car.",1
"Where do I even begin? I ordered my food at 9:15pm. My delivery time kept increasing, and increasing. Finally at 10:30 I called the restaurant. One of their employees answered and as soon as I said we were the grubhub order he knew exactly who we were. Our food was ready for pickup at 9:22. The driver never showed up. At 10:40, that same employee who is NOT affiliated with grubhub got in his car, on his own time, with his own gas money to bring us our food because he felt bad that we had waited so long. I began a customer care live chat immediately following, asking for a refund because grubhub literally did nothing to deserve our money. The restaurant was amazing, and ordering from grubhub made our experience horrendous, we didn't get our food in a timely manner, grubhub played no part in the delivery of the food, and now it is past 11:00 at night and we're finally about to have dinner. This has been horrible. The customer care person refused to refund us, which leads me to my next point of major irritation. We will have to file a credit card claim because grubhub can't even do the right thing and refund loyal customers. I will never use grubhub again and urge anyone who reads this to steer clear. Even the restaurant wants to be done with grubhub, and they will be vouching for me to my credit card company when I file my claim against grubhub.",1
"Awful experience! Order food at 7:05pm. Said estimated was 7:55pm -8:05pm. Nothing changed on my tracker called the restaurant at 8:15pm. The restaurant informed me my food was done awhile ago and simply no one picked it up. Then I called GrubHub customer service. She informed for what ever reason my driver left and I had no driver. And she just put another driver on route to pick up my food. I asked if there was anything she could do. She said she could give me a 10off for my next purchase. I asked if I could have it on this purchase I made now. She kept repeating ""we can give you a code for your next purchase"" I informed her that I rather have it on this purchase since I probably will not use GrubHub again. (Rather just pick up my food when it's warm then get cold food). She then said she could refund the tip I charged to my card. I said no to that.(why would I not tip, since it was a new driver) 10 mins go bye and guess what ?! I still didn't get a new driver. I did get a refund on the plus.  To sum it up I had to contact them to ask why my food wasn't delivered, but the restaurant made my food awhile ago. The said it's because I didn't have a driver.. makes me wonder if I didn't call would I haven't received my food or would I receive it 3 hours later or more ? Don't use GrubHub, your better off picking up your food yourself or using anything else but GrubHub. Unless you want cold food, possibly no driver delivering your food,BUT don't worry you 10 off your next purchase, because the first time experience wasn't bad enough",1
"I don't usually voice my opinion about things but they have gone too far and done nothing to help. I mean I guess I could thank them for the exercise I got from the run around they gave me. This is what I wrote to them and of course got no $#*!ing response. Hello, On Sept 2, 2017 i placed an order through grub hub to luna grill order #1617001691 totaling $25.16 on a card and was told it had been cancelled. I called the number attached to the email and was told that my order was cancelled due to the fact that the delivery driver had been in a minor car accident, so i placed another order elsewhere for more food. I was then delivered my original order from luna grill  after I was told it had been cancelled. I just wanted to make sure that I was not charged the $25.16 from luna grill, because I would. Ever have places a second order for food if i had not been told my original order had been cancelled. I hope this matter gets resolved in a timely manner.  I heard nothing in return and called back after the 3-5 business days. So I waited a little longer. Anyway, finally on my 4th attempt I was told that there was nothing that they could do and to go ahead and file fraudulent charges with my bank. What the actual $#*!?! So they charged me for food I never received and then did nothing but turn a blind eye. Pinchi tontos ($#*!ing idiots) I would have never placed a second order if it wasn't for them canceling my first one. But don't let my experience ruin it for u. Just make sure u really want that food before you place an order. I will never again, I'd rather get up with the worst cold and fever and drive to get whatever I need. $#*!ing grub hub!",1
"This was by far the worst experience I have ever had with any company. My coworkers and I ordered for lunch, which was to be delivered at 10:50. 11:10 came around and we called Grub Hub to find out what was going on with our order as we only get 30 minutes for lunch. The woman on the line was very rude and unconcerned. We informed her that our order said it was delivered and the delivery driver was nowhere to be found. After waiting on hold for 10+ minutes she got in touch with her driver and stated he could not find the office and had returned the food. How is it that it was delivered as the website said, when in reality they had taken it upon themselves to return it without calling or contacting us in any way. We noted specific directions on the notes on our order and also asked that the delivery driver contact us when he arrived. None of which happened. The lady offered for him to bring the food back, however refused to give any sort of refund or discount and this went on for over an hour, so the fries/burger/etc would have been cold by the time this happened. She refused to help and when asked for her manager she placed us on hold for 30+ minutes before we finally hung up and called back. The following representative was asked if she would be able to handle the situation or if we should speak to the manager as we did not want to repeat ourselves a 3rd time. She stated she could and then like the other rep was unable to do anything for us. The best the manager was able to do was give a refund and not ever deliver our food. So we all missed our lunches and as we work 10 hour days this is unacceptable. The drivers excuse was that he could ""not find us and was confused"" even though clear instructions were written on the order. I think it is unacceptable that no one attempted to contact us that the food was returned and that he marked delivered which is a blatant lie. We will NEVER use this service again in the future. I do not recommend Grub Hub to anyone.",1
"This is the first time ever I've used GrubHub, and I'll be damned if it is not the last time, as well.  Typically I just find local restaurants with a delivery option, but since I was craving some gyros and there weren't any delivery choices nearby, I decide to go with GrubHub.  I would've never made that mistake if I wasn't very hungry.  At first it seemed  all cool- the order was placed, there was a spot for any special instructions, and I got a cute confirmation text right away.  The only thing that bugged me right away was a mandatory tip (I prefer to give out cash tips), but whatever.  So far, so good.  Then the trouble started.  Estimated delivery time was about 1 hour from order time, then as the delivery time approached, it was delayed for another hour!  Meanwhile, the online ""tracking status""  showed that the food wasn't prepared yet, which is really weird for gyros. At this point I called the restaurant to see what's going on, and they told me the food was prepared a while ago, but the driver hasn't showed up yet, and asked me if I want to cancel the order since the food would definitely get cold upon delivery.  I decided to keep it since I was still very hungry.  Then I called GrubHub, twice.  The first time a lady who couldn't care less replied that ""there's nothing they can do about it, and no refund can be given whatsoever"".  I hung up and called back again.  This time, a guy who seemed to be frustrated with the entire company he was working for, said that the best they could do is give us a GrubHub discount/credit.  That wasn't much of a solace, since at this point I was determined not to use them ever again, but at least he tried.  Finally, after another cheerful update notifying me that the food is on the way, I received a phone call from the driver saying he was downstairs.  By the time I got it, the food definitely was cold; also, the ""special instructions"" note was mysteriously ignored-  I asked for no pita, but it was still included, and the sauce wasn't on the side as requested.  Of course it could've been the cooks who messed up the order, but judging from all the other reviews, it must be GrubHub that didn't forward the order properly.  So yeah, unfortunately what sounded like a great idea in theory (delivering food from restaurants that don't have their own delivery service to hungry customers) turned out to be a disaster in real life.  Stay away unless you enjoy delayed, overpriced, cold food and crappy customer service!  P.S. I'm surprised nobody got sued yet for food poisoning because of severely delayed food.",1

Grubhub have recently been having trouble with payments: unprocessable.  I called customer service and they said use another card.  I contacted my bank and there is nothing wrong with my card.,0
Great idea but works terribly. Probably nothing against the company but it takes an hour and a half and is always cold and costs $25 for a cheap meal. Just not worth it unless you are starving.,0
never got our food.  Time of delivery kept extending.... the excuse.... no drivers...wtf people... you are a delivery service with no drivers!?!? Don't have drivers then don't take orders morons!,0
"going on 2 hours and 13 minutes and still waiting. The place is less than 2 miles away, does it take grubhub an hour a mile? worst service ever. first and last time I ever use grubhub never again.",0
This is a ridiculously long amount of time to wait for food...restaurants were closing as I was still waiting and didn't have any other arrangements for food that night.  It's a terrible experience.,0
Bad customer service it takes about a hour and a half to get your food just for the order to be wrong missing items no one is held accountable and grub hub still has not refunded me my money Grub hub is,0
Food never arrives on time. Frequently have to wait 30-60minutes extra for food to arrive. Only worth using if you are dead set on ordering from a restaurant that only offers free delivery through Grub Hub.,0
"Do not use this service! They are a ripoff and do not care about the customer. They grab your money and go, that's what they're good at. Do not deliver, will not refund and lies to you. DO NOT USE EVER!!!!!!",0
On 4 separate occasions Grubhub has canceled my order without  notification. The they have the audacity to try and compensate me with$5! Its always an issue with them. I will not be using Grubhunb ever again.,0

"I waited over 2.5 hours and still did not receive my food, finally called and canceled the order. This was not a fluke, since it happened 3 times in a row within a few weeks. This company will go belly-up very soon.",0
"I ordered food from their site, the restaurant didn't have what I ordered, they waited 30 minutes to call me to tell me they didn't have what I ordered. so they cancelled my order after 30 MINUTES ARE YOU KIDDING ME",0
I have tried Grub Hub and not happy at all.  Either restaurant is no longer affiliated but is on the site. Takes your money and then cancels.  Next try waiting 2 hours for delivery.  Unacceptable.  Will not use again.,0
Customer service refused to refund a delivery fee for food I did not recieve and refused to send a driver to deliver the food I paid for but never received.. So I lost money on on an order in which I did nothing wrong.,0
I have ordered from them three times now. First time- the restaurant didnt get the order and the last order half my order wasnt delivered. They forgot items out of my meals. The price is to high for this lousy service.,0
"Absolute garbage customer service. Was threatened, and got many copy and paste texts when I had a question about something. They also tried to cut me off many times short and kept repeating the same thing over and over.",0
"When I placed the order it said 30 minutes.  Then it changed to over an hour. It's only 4 miles from where I am, but I'm in a semi and can't go just anywhere.  And I'm on a schedule.  I don't recommend this service at all.",0
GrubHub and its competitors are way too expensive and frankly not worth it . I go with beyond menu they charge $1 delivery fee and then I tip the driver the only problem is they don't have a whole lot of restaurants just yet.,0
Tried to use grub hub 3x in the last month and EVERY SINGLE TIME the orders keep getting pushed back over and over and over and over again. If you don't mind waiting almost two hours for cold food go ahead and waste your money.,0
Ordered my first and last meal with GrubHub today.  Didn't get my food but I was charged and they refuse to refund me.  Basically what everyone else is saying.   Please take our advice and stick to UberEats or regular delivery.,0
I used their service until they spoke out with political partisanship. Never again. There are other services like Skip the Dishes that provide the same thing and don't succumb to politics. Look it up and make your own judgment.,0
"Food that never arrives, customer service that runs you in circles without ever addressing your problems, and the best they are willing to offer in compensation is an apology. If I could give zero stars you can bet that I would.",0
"Don't use it. Even restaurants owner.They turn your restaurant off whenever they want. Their only answers are just ""I don't know "" OR "" not enough delivery guys""  If you like the food from other restaurants directly call to them.",0
Their customer service is beyond ridiculous. I waited over two hours to be told that no one was dispatched. They offered me 10 whole dollars fire my $40 order that ended up being cancelled. Will never do business with them again.,0
"Order was supposed to be delivered by 10:30 ended up getting my food at 11:30.. An hour later. Food was cold: Wings, fries and chicken tenders from Buffalo Wild wings. Dinner sucked and I paid $75 for it. NEVER will I use grub hub again.",0
"It doesn't matter whether the restaurant is at fault on your order, they do nothing to compensate you all; they have a $10 min on orders, before tax, so if a part of your order is screwed and it costs less than that, don't expect to eat.",0
"restaurant directly, I got a really nasty guy who said that he called me when he did not.  I went online to try to get grubhub involved and they were completely useless. The food arrived late and cold and grubhub was not concerned at all.",0
Stay away from grub hub if you order through them and the restaurant cancels the order they claim they will refund your money but they won't I still have not received my money for my order they still owe me so beware of this crooked company,0
"After taking $40 for $16 worth of burritos they simply never showed up despite a confirmation of recept on their stupid website tracker. Can't offer a refund until they talk to the store, which can't happen until next week. Thaaaanks, Grubhub",0
"I called after two orders were canceled and guess what, GrubHub offered me a five dollar credit and the guy on the phone sounded like a robot like he didn't care at all and that it was something so common for them that they're just used to it.",0
"They make false claims of offers, sending emails and push notifications and then will not honor them at checkout. They have done this multiple times and it demonstrates unethical advertising practices, including but not limited to bait & switch.",0
It is horrible i want to buy one thing for nine dollars and i have to spend 18 or more just to proceed to checkout i cant even get a sandwich for 9 dollars you are forced to pay a minimum balance of 18 if you go below you cant proceed to checkout,0
"After waiting an hour for my food delivery, the company sent me a text telling me that my order was cancelled. I called their customer service and they stated they didn't have anyone to deliver the food in my area. LOL What a bunch of idiots......",0
"Have used grubhub twice, over both orders we have been shorted over 50 dollars worth of food, the second time we ordered the food was completely mixed up, half of what i wanted in half of what my wife wanted. Feel like i have been robbed... twice.",0
"Placed an order, waiting over an hour for delivery.  Called the restaurant to see if it had been picked up and was told it had been canceled 45 minutes earlier.  I didn't cancel it, Grub Hub did without any notification.  I know not to use them now.",0
Waited an hour despite being quoted 35-45 minutes. Called. Was told I would be compensated and order would arrive within half an hour. It never did. Got a text 15 mins later to inform me my order was cancelled. Restaurants now closed. They're awful.,0
"Ordered taco bell, $#*! was a hour late. After I called for a refund I called my bank card and they took out more money than what they were supposed to. Tf I will never order from punk ass slow ass grub hub again . And I would not reccommend to anybody",0
I wish I had read these before I ordered - they are disgusting. If you order from Grubhub - be sure you understand you may or may not get your order - they are clueless. I also wouldn't trust that the food is fresh - will never order through them again.,0
I will never use GrubHub again.  Twice already they pushed my order delivery time 1.5 hours past the original delivery time.  Called customer service was on hold for over 20 minutes.  I don't understand how a company survivors with this awful of service!!!,0
"Site doesn't work, login doesn't work, tried every login option. First and last time I'll attempt to order thru grubhub. Oh and ""connect with us"" doesn't have any contact info. Waste of time. I am tech savvy and this site just does not work. Look elsewhere.",0
I used for a work function in Portland OR--food was over 1.5 hrs late.  Tried tonite in AZ ordered at 7:26 with eta of 8:25-8:35.  Got a nice little text at 8:47 that order had been delivered when in fact it had not.  Never again my friend do not recommend!,0
"if only there were a rating of -1. i cannot think of one occasion where i received an order from grubhub without some sort of complication. i guess jokes on me for continuing to use this app. NEVER AGAIN. worst customer service i've ever received, hands down.",0
"THE WORST - the absolute worst.  They FREQUENTLY cancel orders AFTER you've waited an hour and longer for food.  It's absolutely ridiculous.  And then they give you a ""discount"" on your NEXT ORDER.   Forget it - I'm Uber Eats all the way.  Screw you Grub Hub.",0
"I hate GrubHub so incredibly much. I wish restaurants didn't require customers to use it. I've been fighting with this website for 45 minutes! I'm now looking for a different place to get food. I gave 1 star because zero wasn't an option. GrubHub, I HATE you.",0
Bad service ....tried 2 x and orders were canceled !  Crampy !  X. Cr happycr happy etc etc etc and 100 more ltrs xXxX.   Xxx x just crappy etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc and c,0
Food cold!!  Took forever!!  Only received a small part of the order.  When I told the driver he said there was nothing he could do and left.  Called customer service.  They would not give me a full refund even though two people in my house will not have dinner.,0
"Horrible customer service. Consistently gets orders wrong, including missing items, then refuses to refund. Apparently, GrubHub thinks it has the right to take a customer's money, regardless of whether it upholds its end of the bargain. Not cool. Not cool at all.",0
"Its been waiting 2 hours since Ive placed my order and Im still waiting for my Food to be delivered (from 15 mins away). Im confused???? I could have walked there, got food and eaten it in a faster time. This is my first experience with grubhub and I am NOT HAPPY.",0
"They take your money they dont deliver the food and they wait over an hour or more to cancel. Then they lie and say the restaurant was closed when obviously that is completely false. I have 3 refunds that I havent received yet. They are incompetent, liars. Beware!!",0
"Placed my order through grub hub and 45 minutes later they emailed me that it was cancelled!! By that time, it was too late to place a new order (9pm) and this has happened to me 3 times before, but tonight got me fuming!! I'm done with Grub hub! No more chances for you.",0
"Used twice.   First time over an hour late.   Second time,  never arrived.   Recieved call from grubhub 2 hours after I placed the order saying that there was a mix up and that the driver hadn't even left the restaurant.   Canceled the order and will never use grubhub again.",0
"I just ordered through Grub Hub again and this time it wasn't late, they just didn't place my order but charged me for the food.  On hold, basically this service SUCKS and I will not use it again, suggest you don't either if you want to eat.  How are they staying in business?",0
We usually order via Foodler and have had no issues. Unfortunately Foodler has been acquired by Grubhub and now all orders are through GrubHub. We ordered this evening and got an email an hour later saying our order was cancelled. Reason was not clear. Overall a waste of time.,0
I had  trouble placing an online order and called Grubhub customer service to assist.  After two phone calls to different reps were unable to assist providing no help and seemingly  being unfamiliar with the current promotions. Big waste of time and energy. Stick with postmates,0
horrible horrible horrible- do not use- will not take accountability for anything- will be on hold for like 4 hours and not talk to anyone- the ceo of this company needs to rethink the business model- so unhappy- used services for four to five years- will never again!!!!!!!!!!!!!,0
"Places an order a day ahead of time and scheduled to me delivered between meetings (11:30a.m.).  Did not show up until 12:30pm.  Food was cold.  I called the restaurant to make sure it wasn't there fault, but they had the food ready and waiting.  WILL NEVER USE THIS SERVICE AGAIN!",0
"First and last time I use GrubHub, I ordered and heard nothing after ""your order is cooking"". It simply never arrived. When I called the restaurant, they pretended to have no idea what I was talking about. Really would have appreciated some dinner as I was at work until 11:00pm :(",0
"GrubHub has ruined all my favorite delivery services!!!! Searching on their website it lame, why is it the the food on grubhub is more expensive than when the restaurant offers delivery on other sites?, and now my orders never seem to make it to the restaurant...please stop GrubHub!",0
"This is a huge scam, we ordered food and like many reviews here they never got delivered to us and their customer representative refuses to refund the money and give you a stupid $20 dollar credit which is useless cause you have to use it in 30 days. Stay away from this scam business!",0
Grubhub absolutely sucks when it comes to delivery!! Either the food is extremely late getting to you or they won't show at all. You call customer service and all they offer you is a sorry! You have to ask for a refund. You'll be better off going to pick up the food you want yourself.,0
GH cancelled my simple Rubio's order yesterday.  They said they were too busy!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! WTF ?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!? TOO BUSY??????????  When I heard that I called them to complain.   They said most likely it was Rubios that canceled b/c THEY were too busy.  THAT'S bull$#*!!!!!!!!!!!!,0
"They offer an ""automatic discount"" that they do not apply then charge a fortune for food that should ordinarily be inexpensive. And, it takes forever. I am not typically one to complain, but this was a joke and I ended up paying $22 for a $6 sandwich and chips. I will never use them again.",0
"They took my money but never placed my order. I found out when I called the restaurant. Then customer service was a long wait to get the order cancelled, which is weird because it was never placed, but still needed to get my money back. Card was charged, I hope the refund posts just as quickly.",0
We placed order couple of times but food never arrived even after they confirmed that it will arrive in 40-50 minutes. After 1 hours on calling customer care - they said that no driver is available !! What a joke !! Is this how anyone can run the business !!   Stay away guys from this service !!,0
i orders bbq through grubhub the woman took half our order took our brisket from the container pretty much too half of our food and we called $#*!eys to see where our food was the manager had personally packaged our food and he said everything was in the bag and it shouldve arrived but it didnt .,0
My first ordering experience was extremely disappointing beyond words. Food wasn't delivered until 2 hrs and and it was cold and not edible. customer service put me hold more than 15 mins and it is was incredibly ridiculous. Never ordering again! THE WORST EVER CUSTOMER SERVICE I HAVE EXPERIENCE!!!!,0
Some law firm should bring a class action suit against GH. They cancel your order but you do not get a credit card refund for a number of days. While you wait GH uses your money and you are paying interest if you have a credit card balance. GH should be liable for the money and also pay punitive bdamages,0
Grubhub stole my credit card information when I placed an order with them in Fort Lauderdale. They denied it although the card was only used for that one transaction in six months. The restaurant never had the info nor the driver. It was the administrator of the site. They still denied it. NEVER AGAIN!!!,0
"Waited for our food for two hours then received a notice our order was cancelled with no explanation. Save your money and time, go elsewhere. Previous two times orders were missing items and we were giving it one more chance. Obviously a mistake, these people need to learn how to provide quality control.",0
"Grubhub should go out of business with UberEATS hitting the scene. I have had 3 orders now in which they use a crappy restaurant that is 3 hours late with my order.  My order tonight was just not confirmed with the restaurant, and no notification. Customer service didn't even offer anything!!  They suck!",0
"I've ordered through GrubHub a few times with mixed results. Unfortunately, it seems that the service is in serious decline in recent months. Out of the last 4 orders I've placed 3 have been significantly late (over 40 minutes). Contacting customer service has useless and they seem to willfully unhelpful.",0
"I should have read the reviews first. To make a long story short, ordered food at 7:26pm. it is 9:07pm and food isn't here yet. I even got a call from the restaurant I ordered from to say the food has been sitting for an hour, and I shouldn't use Grubhub, they do this all the time. Stay away from Grubhub.",0
"Grubhub messes up my order to my detriment and their gain every day. I pay for items I don't get every day. ""Customer care"" is intentionally annoying to deal with to deter customers from even bothering to attempt to get their $ back because dealing with their team of idiots is another wasted hour of life.",0
I ordered from California Pizza It was delicious but cold. I called because my order was an hour and a half late and the lady apologized and said she would send us a 10 dollar coupon that never came. If you like cold food and feeling hangry I guess GrubHub is the place for you. Awful first time experience.,0
Late deliveries. Deliveries never made. Deliveries seldom wrong when they were made. Customer service is nothing but a call center with people who are hard to understand who cannot help you. Left on hold multiple times for over 20 minutes while trying to make a complaint with the customer service (call center),0
"I used grub hub to place a delivery order for the first time, from a place I usually order from... but my order was delivered a half hour AFTER their allotted time frame. I wouldnt use this service again, and Since I prepaid I included a 20% that should have been way less. ALWAYS CALL & Always tip upon delivery",0
"I ordered for our office a little after 11:30 am.  In five minutes, the delivery time had changed to 3:02 pm.  $50 for two people for sandwiches from a place 10 minutes away.  Called to cancel and what a surprise-couldn't.  When the food came, it was very marginal and cold.  SO never again, GrubHub.  Don't do it.",0
DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY WITH GRUBHUB. GOOD CHANCE YOU WONT RECIEVE YOUR ORDER IT WILL BE HOURS LATE AND DISGUSTING AND GRUBHUB WILL DO NOTHING BUT OFFER A FEW DOLLARS CREDIT. WILL SPREAD THE MESSAGE TO AS MANY PEOPLE AS POSSIBLE. GO TO DOORDASH!! MUCH BETTER CUSTOMER SERVICE AND MORE VARIETY OF RESTAURANTS,0
"Order already late, now a lame story that I canceled the order.  Back 2 Uber Eats!  That's what I get for chasing ""Waterfalls"" & trying something new.  I will pay the $7 delivery fee to deal with competent individuals. The only thing ppl do right & swift is deduct the funds from your acct.  All downhill after that",0
