"Could’ve been a little bit better. He tried his best, but I’ve had better drivers in the past. He could easily improve though. I’m just talking about this one present situation in particular.",1
"My experience with my ride today was absolutely awful. I requested a ride to work, it was going to be a very important day. The driver took a route that was very congested with traffic, and it took forever! I ended up being 45 minutes late to work. Because I was late, I missed my meeting. Missing the meeting caused the contract that we were negotiating to be cancelled, and my business lost a lot of money. My boss was furious and screamed at me. Thanks for the crappy ride.",1
"The driver took a long route with a ton of traffic. This caused me to pay an extremely high charge, AND be late to my meeting. I'm not sure why she didn't take another route. Would not drive with again. ",1
My driver unfortunately made a mistake in choosing a very congested route today and it took me alot more time and money to get to work. But these things happen. I could have made the same choice driving myself so the driver cant be blamed for something out of their control,0
"This is the WORST driver ever. I showed up almost an hour late to my job. I had a meeting with a very important client which I lost because of how late I was. Then my boss yells at ME for it even though I told him it was the drivers fault. On top of that the driver charged me way too much money. So I had to pay extra to show up late and get in trouble at work basically. This was the worst experience in the history of driving, maybe ever.",1
I was late for a meeting because this driver couldn't get me to work on time. I got in a lot of trouble with my boss. I would not recommend this driver to anyone! ,1
I am very upset with this driver. He took the wrong route and got us stuck in traffic. I faced many challenges at work as a result of being late because of this driver. I won't use this service ever again and demand a refund.,1
"I was late to work on my last uber ride. My driver decided to take the way with the most traffic. I sat in the Uber for 45 minutes. Because of this, I was charged a very large bill. I am very upset about this. Not only was I late for work, I also missed a very important meeting resulting being yelled at by my boss. I am unsure if I will use this service again.",1
"This easily was the worst experience in a ride sharing service that I have ever had. I not only got overcharged, but I was also late. That caused me to lose a contract and get in trouble at work. It was hell. ",0
"I don't know if it was his fault or if it was really the only route available at the time - but this driver took the worst way possible, ended up costing me extra, and I missed the meeting I meant to get to all along. Again, I don't know if it was this drivers fault or if there was nothing he could of done - but it was a bad experience with Uber itself.",0
This driver took a route that was notorious for taking longer than any other route and caused me to pay more for the usually more simpler ride. I am unpleased with this service that the driver gave me.,1
"The experience was not good.   The driver made a judgement taking a route which was the wrong choice.    This resulted in me being late to a meeting, losing a contract.  Very costly to myself and the company.   To add insult ot injury, I was charged the extra time that was certainly not my choice or mistake.  Never again.",1
"This ride was a tremendous mistake. The driver took the worst route possible which ended up severely harming my professional responsibilities. I expect safety, a certain amount of courtesy, but also efficiency in getting me to my destination. The last item was absent from my experience. ",1
This was a horrible experience.  The driver to a congested route and I was delayed by 45 minutes.  I was late for were I needed to good and had to foot the bill for this expensive ride. ,1
 I am very unhappy with this particular ride. This driver shows a high traffic route to take me to my destination. There were other routes where I could have made it there quicker and the driver did not take those routes. I am very upset because this made me very late for my engagement.,1
I know traffic happens. I should have done a better job planning for it. But the route this driver took was insane. It's like he was aiming for the traffic. ,1
Poor decision maker and didn't follow GPS  and/or warnings about traffic. Cost me a ton both monetarily and professionally. Charged me for a 45 minute delay in traffic.  Do Not Recommend.,1
"I had a very unpleasant experience with one of the drivers that resulted in some difficulties for me on the job.  Rather than taking a simple and fairly quick route that would have gotten me to work on time, this driver chose a route that was heavily trafficked which caused me to be 45 minutes late to work and caused me to miss an important meeting, which resulted in an unpleasant encounter with my boss.  I believe this was a deliberate attempt to earn a larger fare (which it did!).  I will never allow this driver to drive for me again, and if anything like this happens again in the future with another driver, the company will lose my business for good.",1
I was not impressed with my Uber experience. The driver took a strange route to my  job even when I told him there was a faster route. I arrived to work 45 minutes late. This caused some issues with my superiors and also cost our company an important contract. I am not happy with the service. ,1
"I will never use the driver from uber again. I will also consider not using uber in the future. The uber driver took a route that was high in traffic which the driver could have avoided. This traffic caused a 45 minute delay and I was late to work. When I arrived at work ""LATE"" because of the uber driver taking a route that was full of traffic I was lucky not to get fired.  The driver from uber caused me to be late at work. This caused a domino effect of several problems at work because I was late. The driver had access to maps and should have chosen a different route to get me to work on time.",1
"the driver was not cautious and took a route in which there was a lot of traffic so he made me arrive very late to my destination, an important meeting, causing serious problems in my work",1
"The driver took a route with a lot of traffic, which resulted in my being 45 minutes late to work. Because of this I missed a very important meeting, a contract was cancelled, and I got yelled at by my boss. I realize that this was a mistake, but it really costed me time, money, and possibly future job stability.",1
"I have to say that this driver is probably the worst I have ever had using this company. Not only did he try to bilk me by taking a long route that caused me a lengthy delay and a higher fee, he also caused me considerable harm at work by doing this. I would give a rating of zero if I could - he was and is the worst driver I have ever had - so much so, I am considering never using this service again based solely on this experience. If this is the level of driver they employ, then its just not worth it in any way for me to continue using this service. ",1
Horrible driver. Didn't know alternate routes to my destination. Got us stuck in a massive traffic jam. Made me late to work and an important meeting. Would never use again. ,1
"The driver chose a route with a ton of traffic, which made me miss an important meeting at work. I was also overcharged for the ride. Very disappointed.",1
The driver was not very good cause he didn't know the optimal route to my destination.  And on top of the cost were way to high.  This caused me to be late to work on top of that,1
Unfortunately I did not have a very good experience with this driver.  I am not sure why but they chose the route with the heaviest traffic and it caused me to me extremely late for a very important business meeting.  I am not sure if they just are unfamiliar with the area or were looking to have their fare bumped up but either way I would not recommend this person to anyone.,1
This person purposely took a long way so that I would have to pay more. I ended up late for an important meeting at work and got in trouble. I do NOT recommend this driver!!!,1
I had an important meeting in my office and if i don't attend that meeting my the contract being cancelled and my boss shouted at me. The driver took the traffic route so that he can earn more money. I was really frustrated that why i had taken this uber ride and i want that driver should be fired from his job.,1
My driver took a bad route to work that ended up getting us stuck in traffic for far too long. I ended up missing an important meeting and screwing up company business because of my driver's bad routing.,1
Had a bad experience with the driver due to them choosing a very congested route. I was very late to an important affair. Hope it was just a bad day for them.,1
"I wanted to get to work for a meeting. So I used the app to get a driver. So far, so good. The guy shows up pretty much on time, but then proceeds to take the route with the most traffic. I wind up 45 minutes late, missed the meeting, and got yelled at by my boss for blowing a contract. This is the worst driver I have ever encountered.",1
My driver was not very good at navigating traffic this morning. He took the long way around to work and I was very late. All of this and the fare came in very overpriced.,1
Yeah. It's very disappointing at the moment and  Alice is sometime's very quick and almost missed an important meeting in to the normal mode of the negative response.,0
"Although a nice driver, the experience was not positive. The chosen route had a large amount of traffic, resulting in me being very late to my destination. The results of this were very bad. I would not ride with this driver again.",1
I was incredibly late to work due to this driver's decisons. As such I was unneccesarily repremanded by my boss. This driver needs to learn alternate routes or something before picking people up again during busy hours.,1
"The absolute worst ever!!! I wouldn't get in his car if I was paid too, and I wouldn't recommend you do either. I never experienced anything like this before.",1
"Don't ride with this driver. He made a poor choice of routes making me very late for work. I told him I had to get to work on time, but he still took a route with tons of traffic. I was so upset knowing I was late for work, and we were stuck in traffic. Then he had the nerve to charge me a lot for the ride when he should have offered a discount for his poor decisions. Don't make my mistake-pick another driver!",1
"I felt that the driver took an inferior route and caused me to be late to my destination. Everyone's time is important. This driver should have striven to get me to my destination asap, from my sake, as well as theirs.",1
"This was a horrible experience, the driver took a route that had tons of traffic which resulted in me being late to work.  There was a much better way to get there and yet the driver would not take it .  ",1
This driver took the worst possible route and the fee with all the delays was exorbitant. I had a terrible trip to work and the delay cause me all kinds of problems.,1
"Driver took very indirect routes. As a result, I was late to work and missed an important meeting. Will NEVER use this driver again! Stay away from this driver!",1
"The driver did not take the optimal route which resulted in my being late by 45 minutes and missing and important meeting which resulted in the loosing the client. I was also charged more than the normal fair ride share for such an incredible inconvenience,",1
My driver chose a horrible route and I was late by 45 minutes. They then charged me an unfair rate for their mistake! I will avoid this driver at all costs.,1
That driver is a good driver. He made my travel as a safe travel. Still he need to improve little more his knowledge in choose the quick route than navigation.,0
"Driver took a route that made me 45 minutes late. The price was absurd, especially given the roundabout way they got me to my destination. Not pleased.",1
This driver did not choose a proper route to take. He chose a very busy route that in turn led me to pay a higher price than I normally would have and also caused many issues at my place of employment. ,1
"Ended up being late for work and missed a meeting because route was full of back ups and traffic.  Also got charged a lot because of long trip.  Not sure if the driver could have done better, but not a great expereince",0
The driver was really nice but he didn't seem to know where he was going and I was 45 minutes late. I even told him and suggested ways to go but he did not follow my instructions.,1
This driver was courteous and kind however he took the extemely long route to my job. I ended up having to pay a high amount as well as be late to work and miss an important meeting. I do not recommend.,1
I recently took an Uber to work. The driver chose a route with heavy traffic which made me 45 minutes late to work. I missed an important meeting and suffered repercussions due to the drivers choice of route. I would not ride with this driver if you are trying to get somewhere by a specific time. ,1
The driver took a route that is typically very congested and took an unreasonable amount of time to get me to my destination. On top of all of this I was charged an exorbitant amount of money for the trip due to the 45 minute delay!,1
"While the ride itself was pleasant, the route taken added an additional 45 minutes to my riding time, therefore increasing what I had to pay.  Because of the route chosen, it affected my work in a very negative manner and I lost business due to this.  If the driver had chosen a less busy route, it would not have taken as long as it did.  ",1
"Driver took the longest route possible which resulted in a 45 minute delay in getting to work as well as a much higher price than I normally pay. Not only was I late to work because of this, but I also faced several consequences. I absolutely would NOT recommend or use this driver ever again.",1
"My driver did not make any attempt to avoid heavy traffic. Because of this, we took 45 minutes longer than we needed to. I was late to an important business meeting and lost a contract. On top of that all, the price for the ride was outrageous!",1
THE LAST RIDE I CONTRACTED FOR WITH UBER WAS UNACCEPTABLE. THE DRIVER TOOK A ROUTE THAT HAD A LOT OF TRAFFIC. THE RIDE TOOK 45 MINUTES AND THE PRICE I PAID WAS EXCESSIVE. THE RIDE RESULTED IN AN IN MISSING AN IMPORTANT MEETING AND COULD HAVE BEEN AVOIDED IF A BETTER ROUTE HAD BEEN TAKEN.,1
I ended up being late to an important meeting due to traffic. I feel like the driver could have taken a faster route and should have been aware of potential traffic.,1

"The driver took a route that had an unacceptable amount of traffic. There are very simple navigation apps to get around this, and not using them properly was unacceptable. I was also charged far too much for the ride. This whole experience cost me both time and money. ",1
"Shortest route was congested. Rather than ask me if i wanted to take an alternatve, driver moseyed along in traffic, taking 45 mins. I missed a meeting at work and was charged an outrageous price for what should have been a ten minute trip. Not a happy camper",1
"I had booked Uber for going to office, I didn't him driver about my urgency and so he had taken route with huge traffic by thinking as very less distance, because of him I didn't attend meeting which had been cancelled, after entering in to traffic I informed about my urgency, so he didn't able to do anything. Anyways I missed my meeting and got scoldings from my boss.",1
"Route chosen was extremely poor, resulting in my being 45 minutes late for important work meeting. Proper use of traffic information such as Waze is critical.",1
with out a basic route skills and he also charged me high rate ...i was late 45 min because of the driver very very poor skills for the driver ...the day was too bad only because of driver ,1
it was a very bad experience as the driver picked me up late and took up the long route in spite of telling him that this route will have a lot of heavy traffic at this time of the day.He was basically very adamant and i felt him to be rude and did not understand my concern and there by i was stuck in traffic for a very long time which delayed my schedule.,1

This Uber driver does not take optimal routes. The driver turned my trip into an unnecessarily long nightmare waiting in traffic for forty five minutes.,1
My driver was a moron. They went he wrong way to my job and I was late to work and missed a meeting over them being an idiot. They should not be able to work in this line of field if they don't know how to get places quickly. ,1
"This driver took a long way that got us stuck in traffic. I was very late for my work because of this and got into trouble with my boss and at my job. The driver got a lot more money because of the longhauling, but I got screwed. I wouldn't use this driver again. ",1
He took a stupid route and made me late to work and charged me a ridiculous amount. My job is in jepordy because he wanted to take the long route to charge me more. ,1
"This driver took me on a high-traffic road when I was trying to get to work on time. I ended up being late to work, and with the drive taking longer due to the traffic, I was charged extra for the extra time. Very frustrating experience, though it was only partly the driver's fault.",1
"One of the worst experiences I have had. I think he purposely took a route with a lot of traffic, in order to be able to charge me more. Due to that, the route took much longer than usual and I was late to work which had severe consequences. Horrible experience overall.",1
"The driver not only chose to go an extra long route, but we got stuck in the long route as well. Because of this I was late for a meeting and lost a contract. ",1
"The driver did not look for a route that was not busy and had a lot delays , but took a route that cost me more money and getting to work really late and caused more problems for me, I would not suggest this drive for any regular work day ",1
The driver didn't seem to know the best route to take to avoid traffic at this time of day. My ride to work took way longer than it should have and as a result I was late for work with serious repercussions. To add insult to injury the ride was very expensive. ,1
The driver took a route that was longer than necessary and that caused me to be late for an important meeting. I was also charged a really high price. Avoid at all cost!,1
this driver is not clear in route so its getting me delayed to the meeting and the project was cancelled so i lost the project also he bought too much money,1
"i dont like him because he didnt arrived on time, so i will not book ride after this in your company. i will choose better one for my ride because time is more important for me.",1
Standard pick up but driver opted for a heavy traffic route and then I was charged for that extra time. I felt he was milking the drive. Not only did it cost me in money but because I was late to work it cost me double with a cancelled client. ,1
"I was very upset that this driver took a very crowded route to get me to my destination, I was late for work.  I was also charged a very high amount. I will re-think taking this service in the future. ",1
