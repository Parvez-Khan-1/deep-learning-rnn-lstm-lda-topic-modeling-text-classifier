"I know it's probably the restaurant's fault and not the driver, but I'm mad that he didn't realize that the order was wrong. I had to throw the whole meal out and couldn't eat any of it.",1
I don't know who put in or created my order but I was all wrong. The ingredients I wanted were not included. I asked for no peanut spreads as I'm allergic. The food was inedible so I lost money.,0
"I used the delivery service Grubgrab and got the wrong meal. I think the driver should be checking the meal when it is picked up, just like I would before I drive home. I think that otherwise the dinner was delivered just fine. But next time I'll do a reminder that to check the meal and you might all want to do that too.",1
"I was unable to get my order right. Half of the items were wasted because of this and the allergies I have. I wish that my driver would have checked the order, that is why I use the service in the first place. Useless.",1
"I received my food on time and my delivery person was courteous, but my order was wrong. I don't think its the delivery person's fault. The restaurant messed up my order and forgot one of the ingredients. I also ordered it without peanut butter and there was peanut butter all over my food. I wasn't able to eat my lunch and had to go without lunch because I didn't have extra money to buy something else. I'm upset at the restaurant I ordered from, not the delivery driver. ",0
This service was horrible! I ordered food and it did not have my favorite ingredient in it. I ordered the food because of that ingredient. Also they put nuts in it and I am allergic to nuts so I cannot eat it. Horrible experience!,0
"This delivered meal was completely  wrong.  I am so upset and will not use this service again!  not only was my order wrong, but it came with a peanut spread, when I am allergic to nuts so I  could not eat the meal due to this, forcing me to go  the entire day without lunch.  I would never recommend them to any of my friends or colleagues at this point.  I'm very disappointed with the guy who delivered my order.",1
Well they didn't listen to a word I said so now I can't eat my meal. If I have any type of peanut in my food I can go into anaphylactic shock and die. That is not what I want for lunch? Is that what you want me to have for lunch? Death?,0
"The delivery person was careless. She should have checked to make sure that the order was prepared as ordered before delivering it. Even though the mistake with the order may not have been her fault, it is still her responsibility to verify that the delivery is what the customer ordered.",1
I specifically asked for no peanut butter because I am allergic to that and I got that in my meal. I was unable to eat this because of my allergy. I am very disappointed and upset.,0
"I thought the delivery person was nice, but am very unhappy with the service from GrubHub.  My order was completely wrong and this is the restaurants fault.  I will probably not order again as I couldn't eat my food and lost my money and was not able to eat lunch that day. ",0
I am pretty upset about my order. I specifically asked to not have peanut butter on it as I am allergic to peanuts. When I opened up my order it was covered in peanut butter. I am now out of cash and hungry :(. The delivery person obviously was not paying attention to orders!,1
"Worst experience ever, never using Grubhub again.I ordered lunch from my favorite restaurant to eat on my lunch break. I open the box to find out that my meal is missing an ingredient. Not only that but I requested no peanut butter because I'm allergic and the dish was covered in peanut butter. Grubhub could have killed me. ",0
"Order was wrong and do to allergies could not even eat it. Lost money and didn't get to eat. Waste of money and time, would have been better off going to get the food myself.",0
My delivery person did not check to make sure the food was as ordered before delivering it. They forgot to leave off the peanut butter spread so I was unable to eat it due to my nut allergy. Such a disappointment! ,1
"This restaurant is so bad! The delivery person gave me the right food, but without the correct specifications. They also took my money, but I wasn't able to eat my meal!",0
"the meal came without the ingredient I ordered, and plastered with peanuts which I'm allergic to, now my break is over and I don't have the time or money to get another meal. i don't believe is the delivery person's fault but I'd definitely think twice before ordering from this app again",0
"I'm not sure if it was the fault of the delivery person or driver, but my meal did not arrive how I ordered it. I specifically asked for a certain food item to be included and it wasn't. And I specifically asked that a certain food item not be included and it was. Very disappointed!",0
The delivery person did not bring me the right item. I do not kind though cause I know those apps can be confusing and perhaps the app itself did not register the order in the way I intended. Oh well. I will live. ,1
This person couldn't even check my order to make sure that it was right before bringing it to me. Everything was completely wrong and I have no way of getting a new meal because I spent the last of my money on this one. Horrible service. ,1
"I am very upset with my service. First, I have allergies to peanuts and my food contained peanut butter - this is something that delivery drivers should check before delivering the food. They should always be checking that the food matches the order exactly, and thats even more important when allergies are involved. Second, it was missing the 1 item I was really looking forward to! Again, had the driver checked, I would have had my full meal. ",1
"I only have an allotted amount of time for lunch, so when I order lunch I can't afford it to have any mistakes! My order today had peanut butter in it which I am highly allergic to. To make matters worse, it was missing the one thing that I was really looking forward to eating and specifically ordered. I would never order from here again. Their delivery people obviously are careless and the company isn't concerned about us customers.",1
"I was very displeased at the fact taht my food had peanut butter scattered all about. I am allergic and the driver seemed not to care that all this was splashed over my food. What might seem small to the delivery service is something actually quite big to me, and dangerous. I am upset. ",1
"I am very unhappy with my experience today. I had ordered from this place for a specific ingredient and it was forgotten! I also specified no peanut butter, as I am allergic to nuts, and it came with peanut butter all over it! This is unacceptable. It is the responsibility of the deliver person to make sure they are delivering the right meal! This did not happen, and I could not eat any of the meal that I had paid for. So disappointed and angry at the incompetent delivery person, who brought me food, without checking it first, that I cannot eat! ",1
"I am not happy with the service I got. They forgot the special ingredient I wanted, and they put peanut butter all over the food after I told them I was allergic to nuts. I could not eat it!",0
"I don't want to shoot the messenger, but my meal was completely incorrect. It was missing the main ingredient and in addition had a peanut sauce that I did not order. I am allergic to peanuts and am very disappointed with the service as I was unable to have lunch today and my meal could have killed me. ",0
"While this is not the fault of the delivery person entirely, it still makes me quite angry that he/she did not double check my order, and so I ended up getting my food delivered without my favorite ingredient - which is why I ordered it in the first place! And to make matters worse, it came with peanut butter spread and I am ALLERGIC to nuts.  So, I ended up not being able to eat my meal and went without lunch altogether! By far the worst experience I have had with a delivery service platform in my entire life. I will not ever use again, nor do I recommend anyone using them! Awful experience. ",1
"The delivery person was very on time and nice.  My meal was incorrect, but i know it wasn't that persons fault.  Would recommend this individual.  They were prompt and nice and gave correct change quickly.",0
"I do not think it was the fault of the delivery person that the meal was completely wrong. Afterall he is the delivery person and is not the chef or the cook who prepared the meal. She should not be upset with him and she should deal with the restaurant itself. The question is did the delivery person delivery the meal on time, was he courteous to her, etc. ",0
I was very disappointed with this order.  My food was inedible and there was nothing that I could do.  I would not have food delivered again.  I think the delivery person should have checked my order to make sure that it was correct.,1
The delivery was not at all aduquate.  They messed up my order and brought me food that I was allergic too.  I am very disappointed in the service they provided.  ,1
"As far as delivery, the delivery came on time and the delivery person was nice and polite. I have no problems there, but the meal was totally messed up by the restaurant.",0
My order was messed up. I trusted the site to get my stuff right but instead they really messed up. I am missing my favorite stuff and on top of it I now have to go without food for the rest of the day due to the peanut butter which I am allegic to.,0
"I'm very unhappy with my hour as it was very inaccurate. It was missing a part of it that was essential to the meal and I specifically asked for no nuts due to an allergy, yet it was covered in peanut butter. This is unacceptable. ",0
"The person that delivered the meal was doing their job.  They were quite pleasant and cordial.  They delivered the food at the time specified.  There was no issue with the delivery person.  They did not prepare or package the food, so I can't really hold them accountable for the wrong items.  At least I don't think so. ",0
"I am not sure who is in charge of making sure that my meal is correct, but I feel as if the delivery person should of been able to put in their part to check my food. I am allergic to peanut butter and my meal was smeared with peanut butter. I also ordered from this specific restaurant because I wanted to get a very specific meal, but the meal came with out the ingredient that I wanted. I believe that the delivery person should make sure that meals are delivered accordingly.",1
The delivery person was not very good. They messed up my order in a way that made it not let me have food for lunch because of their mistake. I would never use their service again.,1
The delivery person brought my meal but it was the wrong meal. I would have preferred the delivery driver to check to make sure the correct meal was given up them to deliver. I understand mistakes can happen but I was unable to eat the meal due to an allergy and also it did not contain what I ordered. I had to go through the day without lunch because the driver was careless and did not check the order. I am very disappointed with this service.,1
The delivery person brought my meal but it was the wrong meal. I would have preferred the delivery driver to check to make sure the correct meal was given up them to deliver. I understand mistakes can happen but I was unable to eat the meal due to an allergy and also it did not contain what I ordered. I had to go through the day without lunch because the driver was careless and did not check the order. I am very disappointed with this service.,1
"An average person trying to make a living. The resturaunt messed up the order, not the delivery person. He just delivered a package of food as instructed. He had no contact with the food whatsoever, othen delivering it. It could be your talking about, I worked in a Chinese resturant as delivery driver for seven years before I started my own company, a medical transport business.",0
"Today I am very disappointed with the delivery to say the least. Although I can't completely blame the delivery driver since they didn't physically make the food, however I think it is their responsibility to check that they have picked up the correct food and to see if there are any errors to the best of their ability. My meal today wasn't slightly wrong - it was completely wrong! And now I am unable to even eat lunch today because of this.",1
"The delivery person delivered the meal on time. However, this is not about the delivery person. This review is directed at the establishment that made the meal. After stating not to have peanut butter in the meal, the meal came loaded with peanut butter. To add insult to injury, I made it clear that I had an allergy to nuts. I am very dissatisfied. I ordered a meal and requested a certain ingredient to be in the meal. However, when it was delivered, on time I might add, this ingredient was missing. ",0
"The person who delivered was fine. Whoever made the meal should be fired, as they could have killed me. I want them fired right now.                                                                                                             ",0
"I ordered from this place because they have one of my favorite ingredients. However, I ordered this time and they didnt include it in my order as well as putting peanut butter when i specified that I had a nut allergy. I am very upset and am reconsidering ordering from here again.",0
"No complaints about the delivery itself or the wait time, however the order came completely wrong despite several clear instructions.  Because these instructions were ignored, my food allergy prevented me from eating any of the food that I paid for and I had to go hungry instead.  I would skip this restaurant entirely in the future, as they don't appear to listen, even when you're very direct with them.",0
My delivery person did not check my order and the order was completely wrong for me. This should never have been delivered to me as is and it should have been checked.,1
"The meal was just completely ruined for me! My delivery person forgot a very important ingredient which was the whole reason I look forward to this specific meal. I also asked for no peanut spread because I'm very allergic with nuts, and the meal came full of peanut spread! I will never trust this service again.",1
"This delivery person clearly does not care about the instructions given with orders. My food came without the main ingredient, which is the whole reason I wanted it, and it was covered in peanut butter when I specifically requested no peanut butter.",1
"It is really a bitter experience with your delivery style. I will not say, that the delivery was late.  But you people have delivered some that of your choice and not what I have ordered. It seems you have done it deliberately.",1
"The food was fucking atrocious. I've eaten ass that tasted better, but the delivery driver was good. He was quick and polite. I will never order from the restaurant again though.",0
The delivery person was very nice and arrived in a timely fashion.  It is a shame that my meal came missing items and plastered in nut products even though I have a nut allergy.  It would have been nice if my order had been double checked before being delivered.,0
"The delivery person from Grub Hub did not do a good job.  I felt like that she was not attentive to the instructions that I provided.  My order was wrong on several different levels.  Consider a different delivery person when going Grub Hub, not one you can rely on.",1
"I am totally upset with the order, you are not all understood my order and this is worst delivery which i got in my life. I am allergic to peanet butter and you didnt offered me the good meal.",1
"Delivery guy looks handsome and delivered the food on time but, my favourite ingredient was not found in the meal that felt bad. I have informed him that, next time onward he should carry the favourite ingredient.",0
The delivery person was professional and he was on-time. But food was bad and my instructions were ignored. I could just say that the the delivery guy is not at fault.,0
"The delivery was not what I wanted. I tried to tell the delivery person this, but they didn't seem the slightest bit interested in what I had to say. At the very least they should have apologized for messing the order up! No apology was offered. I am thoroughly disgusted with this service. Needless to say, I will not be using your service again. ",1
The delivery person is courteous. The delivery person bought food on time. I was allergic to peanut butter so I think that this was not good on the part of the waiter to bring such an item.,0
"Very worst restaurant but not mention delivery person  because order is not control under the delivery person, online orders should responsible only restaurant. So delivery person is not mistake. ",0
"the delivery person only delivery my food , there is no mistake by this person, but the restaurant who take my order that restaurant such a creepy blank minded person who waste my time & money for that person I am hungry all that time",0
Bad experience ever happen in my life all day hungry .The food i ordered was not delivery by u is this your way of customer care. Once check all item is in ordered by the Clint  ,1
that person was quite nice.his delivery approach is very good.he was on a time to deliver.such a nice person to do work like this. i would prefer these kind of persons to the companies,0
"I had no issue with the delivery person themselves, but my meal was missing a key ingredient, and it was covered in peanutbutter, which i had told the restraunt that I was allergic to. I couldnt eat what I had ordered.",0
"i didnt get my meal in time The biggest mistake people make is feedingmy self and trying to get somthing to eat. Home brand, an expensive brand, whatever. It is all bad. ",0
This is my first time using the app.  I believe I was delivered the wrong meal.  It could of been a accident or it could of been incompetence.  I am unsure which it is but I got something totally different than what I ordered. ,1
"My order came and was on time. I liked the driver, but my order was all wrong. I can not fault the delivery driver for the mistake, it was the person who made my order that made the mistake. ",0
"The delivery person was fine and on time, but the meal itself was completely inedible and lacking ingredients and containing ingredients that were requested to be left off. A sad experience.",0
"The driver was acceptable I suppose, but my order was completely messed up, so they obviously did not double check it.  It was missing my favorite ingredient and had vast amounts of ingredients that I am deadly allergic to.",0
"I'm allergic to peanuts so I requested that the entree come without peanut butter. Easy enough, or so you would hope. Instead my meal had peanut butter, which I of course can't eat, so I just had to throw it away. Talk about a waste of time and money!",0
"My dining experience was bad due to the restaurant, and the delivery person did their job adequately. They did the work they were tasked with.  I appreciate their work, even though the meal was a bust. Not the driver's fault. ",0
"The delivery person did his job; he picked up the food at the restaurant and brought it to my workplace.  The delivery person delivered the food promptly and was courteous.  However, I did not receive what I asked for from the restaurant.",0
"The delivery itself was fine, but the order was wrong. I ended up with food that I'm allergic too and unfortunately had to throw away. Not the worst thing in the world, but still was a bummer.",0
"I got the order on time and he was friendly and nice. I would recommend this person to deliver the food to me again, did a great job at what he does. Very responsible.",0
Very worst experience. They do not consider the customer opinion and  serve as they wish. I ordered something and I got delivered something. It was too late and was not on time. Will never order anything from here again.,0
"The delivery person did not make sure that my order was correct before leaving the restaurant.  I had specified no peanut butter and my order contained peanut butter.  Due to my allergy, I could not eat the meal.",1
My food came without my favorite ingredient. I requested it not have any peanut butter spread on it and it came with a lot of it. I am allergic and can not eat the meal now. I am out the food and my money. ,0
"The delivery person was fine. They delivered my order on time and without delay. However, my order was incorrect. I am not sure if this is the fault of the delivery person if they placed my order or the restaurant. Either way, I was not able to enjoy my meal. Very disappointing.",0
She brought me food with an allergen in it and I was unable to eat because of that. Driver's really need to check orders before leaving the restaurant and delivering the food. ,1
"While my delivery person was on time and very courteous, my order arrived with a couple of major issues.  I wish that the delivery person would have verified that my order was correct before bringing it to me.  Now I have wasted my money on a meal that I can’t eat because I am allergic to the ingredients.",1
I got the wrong order and didn't have enough time or money to get something else. I specifically asked for there not to be peanut butter as I have a nut allergy but it was slathered in it.,0
"I don't get how someone can mess up an idea this bad. I mean, it's really simple instructions and yet it was really wrong, even though I stated what I didn't want on it!! Awful...",0
"The delivery person was fine. They did their job, as expected and was on time with it. My neutral is due to the fact the order was messed up and inedible in its current form.",0
"The delivery person gave me my order on time - however, the order was all wrong! It was completely covered in peanut butter, which I explicitly noted I was severely allergic to, and is missing my favorite element of the meal. Whether this is the delivery driver's fault or the restaurant, it doesn't matter. I want a refund.",0
"The delivery person did not seem to care. The order was very badly destroyed, and the one reason I ordered it was ignored. The delivery person also took far too much time to deliver it, so it wound up late.",1
"My meal was completely messed up by the restaurant.  I'm allergic to nuts and asked for NO peanut spread - however my meal was covered in and and I cannot eat it at all.  I also ordered the special because I absolutely love this one ingredient in the dish - and they didn't even include that ingredient!  While the delivery person is not at fault, the restaurant definitely is!  And I think the delivery person should have checked my order before accepting it.",1
"The person who delivered the food was great, the order was wrong, but that is on the restaurant.  I will be taking this up with the restaurant, but it is not the delivery person's fault. ",0
The delivery person brought the food on time unfortunately it was not what I ordered and I ended up being allergic to what was brought.  Probably not the fault of the delivery person however.,0
"The delivery person was fine. The order came out all wrong, but that was not the fault of the delivery person. The delivery person was nice and courteous. I have no complaints about them. They did the job they were supposed to do. The entire experience was a mess, however, because of the restaurant. ",0
"The delivery driver from GrubHub was extremely fast and courteous when delivering my order. I do not have any qualms about dealing with him. However, the place I order from completely screwed up my lunch order.",0
"I have no issue with the delivery person. They did their job correctly. The restaurant is the one to blame here. They severely messed up my order, to the point that I could not even eat it. But again, the driver was great and understand they can't check every order for accuracy, that's the restaurant's job. ",0
"The delivery person was fine, my food came on time. However, I was very upset that the order arrived without the desired ingredients, and that peanut butter was included despite my explicit instructions not too because of my peanut allergy. I don't believe this was the result of the delivery person's error, so they should not be penalized, but I am very dissatisfied by the service in general and by how poorly my order was prepared.",0
It was a normal delivery although they didn't seem to order the food the way I asked them too. Not that big of a deal for me but I can't see myself using Grubhub anymore after this.,1
"I am very upset with the restaurant for getting my order completely wrong. However, the driver did a good job at least. He showed up very quickly and was very polite and respectful when delivering the food.",0
The delivery person is not at fault but whoever made my order didn't follow instructions and could have sent me to the hospital.  I'm allergic to peanuts and could have been seriously hurt.,0
"The delivery person for GrubGrab presented my meal in time and to the right place. Plus, it was hot. Unfortunately the restaurant screwed up the order so I got food that I am allergic too, I think the driver should still double check the order but otherwise the service was fine.",0
"I am very unhappy with my order. Although I got it on time, it was entirely wrong. I could not eat some items because they didn't follow my order directions and gave me the wrong one, and I'm allergic. The driver should have checked.",1
"I am happy with my delivery person, because they delivered my order on time. They were also nice and we talked for a minute before they left. I don't think they had anything to do with my order not being what I ordered, or the missing ingredients. I would recommend this delivery person and would be willing to have them deliver my food in the future. ",0
"The order was on time and the delivery person was nice. Sadly, my order was completely wrong. i could not eat it because I am allergic to nuts. I would not use this service again.",0
"While the meal was not to my liking, the delivery person fulfilled his end of the bargain and gave good service.  He got me what he thought was my order and I have nothing bad to say about the delivery person since  he is simply doing his  job.",0
The food did arrive on time and I have qualms about that. The order itself is hwat was screwed up so this may be no fault of the delviery drive rhimself as I don't know hwether he packed the food or nog,0
"The delivery person provided bad service. She delivered the order without checking that it had been prepared the way the customer ordered it. The mistake on the preparation was probably a mistake the chef or whoever prepared the order made, but the delivery person is at fault for not checking that the order was prepared correctly.",1
"While my order was not correct, the delivery person was on time and respectful. So, I give them a good review. I think they did a good job. Please do not give them guff for the restaurant getting my order wrong.",0
The delivery person was prompt and nice.  I am happy with the service he provided and would be happy to have him deliver my food again.   He seems like a people person. ,0
The delivery person arrived on time and was polite. I could not ask for more as far as the delivery service goes but the food aspect of my order was totally wrong.,0
Delivery person from Grubhub was pretty good. He arrived fairly fast and came to the front desk at my work. He confirmed my order and was very pleasant. ,0
Delivery arrived on time. Order was inaccurate but that's not his fault. No problems with delivery to report. Would recommend but not for restaurants that can't get orders right.,0
My delivery person brought me my meal on time. They were very professional and did their job well. They did a good job and did everything that could be expected of them. ,0
"The delivery person was very respectful, and did his/her job quite well. Even though I wasn't satisfied with the food, I did appreciate the quality of service from the delivery person.",0
"received an inedible meal, however, it was not the delivery person's fault, he/she was respectful on delivered the meal promptly. i will however, think twice before ordering anything from this app again",0
"Although the delivery driver was courteous and on time, my order however was not acceptable. My request for a certain food item to be included was not. And my request for a certain food item to not be included was included. Very disappointed.",0
"Usually, people would express outrage at getting the wrong order. But, this person delivering the food got it to me quickly and they were kind. I do not think they intended to mess up the order, so all is well with me. ",0
This deliverer was nice and all. I just hated that they didn't even have the decency to check and make sure my order was right before bringing it to me. I feel like that's part of the job too. ,1
"I had some issues with my order and wish the delivery person had checked it to make sure it matched. However, they are ultimately not the one that made the mistake. The order was prompt, delivery person was nice and friendly, and everything went smoothly with them.",1
"I'm reviewing an order that I made for lunch. While my delivery guy was great, he was very nice and on time. My order was all wrong. I realize this isn't the fault of my delivery guy so I am not holding him responsible. It's solely the fault of the person who packed my order. I had no complaints about my delivery guy.",0
"I must say that the delivery driver was on time and respectful and at the end of her day it shouldn't be her fault, but I am upset my food is covered in peanut sauce when I am allergic. ",0
"I got a delivery today that came with missing and wrong ingredients. It was not the fault of the delivery person, as they did not make the food, they were just delivering it. The delivery person was on time, and was nice. I just wish the restaraunt had gotten my order correct, as they put an ingredient I am allergic to on it, that I had specified to leave out! ",0
"The delivery person got my food to me on time, but I could not eat it. I find this to be unacceptable and I will not order from the restaurant again. The deliver was fine, but the food was not what I wanted. ",0
"I am not happy with the meal I received, but the delivery was an acceptable time and the driver was courteous and apologetic for the situation. I was happy with the delivery, but not the restaurant.",0
"The delivery guy/girl was prompt and courteous and arrived in good time. I received my order in time to enjoy for my lunch break, though it was incorrect and I was not able to eat it. I do not believe that this was the fault of the delivery driver, though it was still an unpleasant experience for me.",0
What a prompt and great delivery person!  They were quick to get my food to me.  Once they were here they were so polite and gave correct change without a blink of an eye.,0
as I previously stated the order was not under the control of the delivery person so he should not be faulted for the order. Being that the order was on time and he was respectful he should receive a good rating.,0
The food was not good but the delivery person was respectful and did bring my order on time.  I was not happy with the whole process but that was not the driver's fault.,0
"The actual delivery person was fine.  While the restaurant got my order horribly wrong, the driver did nothing in that regard.  They were on time and respectful and I would use them agian.",0
I feel that the delivery was good. The delivery person was very nice and respectful. They showed up at the designated time and the service was good. I would definitely use the service again.,0
I think the delivery person was fine and the delivery was prompt. Just the food was messed up. I would use the delivery person again as they are not to blame.,0
"Although my order was a mess, The delivery person got my food to me in a timely manner and was professional. I'm happy with the service of the delivery person. ",0
"Again the delivery person did their job adequately.  The showed up within the specified time.  They had items that had been prepared and packaged by others, so they were not liable for the food mistakes.  I think the delivey portion of this situation was fine. ",0
The delivery person was very prompt while delivering the food. The person was very nice and seemed to actually enjoy the work that they were doing. I gave this person a generous tip because of their positive attitude.,0
"The delivery person was average, no issues with them. There was nothing extraordinary or terrible about them. He was friendly as expected of a delivery driver.",0
The driver was courteous and respectful while delivering my food. I had no issues with the driver because they did everything they were suppose to do. I felt the timing was prompt too. I did not have to wait long and when the driver delivered my food they were friendly.,0
The driver was courteous and respectful while delivering my food. I had no issues with the driver because they did everything they were suppose to do. I felt the timing was prompt too. I did not have to wait long and when the driver delivered my food they were friendly.,0
"The delivery person was very timely and concientious. He was very polite, clean cut and drove an old car. I could tell he worked hard at what he did because I had food delivered by him before. A person like anyone else, trying to meet basic needs. ",0
"Today I ordered lunch via delivery. Thankfully the driver was on time and was respectful when I met him, but there were issues with my order that I had. I hope that next time will be a better experience.",0
"The delivery person delivered the meal on time. The time it took to deliver the meal was excellent. The delivery method was by car. The car looked to be clean. The rates for delivery was adequate. Not too high and not too low. However, there was a surcharge I thought was not stated and a bit on the unreasonable side. The deliver was made within a adequate time frame. The person was respectful.",0
"The delivery person was fine. I want the person who prepared the meal fired. Take away their salary, put them in the poorhouse. It's the right thing to do.",0
The delivery driver was kind and courteous and did their best to get the order to me in a prompt manner so that I could eat it on my lunch break. I am happy that they took the least amount of time as possible.,0
"I had no major problems with the delivery person or the delivery itself.  My experience with him was neither impressively positive or negative, though this may have mad more to do with the fact that so much about my food experience outweighed it in terms of my dissatisfaction.",0
"The driver was fine, on time and did their job. There is not much else to say, your driver was fine, the food is what was not fine today. I have nothing else to say about the driver, period!",0
"The meal was just completely ruined for me! Whoever prepared my meal forgot a very important ingredient which was the whole reason I look forward to this specific meal when I order it. I also asked for no peanut spread because I'm very allergic with nuts, and the meal came full of peanut spread! I will never order from this restaurant again.",0
"This delivery person was satisfactory. The food was not what I had asked for, but that wasn't his fault. He was on time and held up his end of the deal fairly well.",0
"He was on time and I dont have complaint on his timing, but what have he checked while lifting the items for delivery. Should be not check with the ordered and to be delivered items in the bill. ",1
"The food was fucking atrocious. I've eaten ass that tasted better, but the driver was good. He was quick and polite which is all you can really expect.",0
"The delivery person was very nice, and my meal arrived on time.  There were no issues to be noted with the delivery, and I would have my order delivered by them again.  The delivery was flawless.",0
"So I got my order from today.  The food was timely and I got it in a reasonable manner.  However, the order was completely wrong.  I am not sure if the problem was hers or it was due to the place I ordered from, but I know as a former deliver person, you always check the order before you leave. ",1
He is good and delivered the meal on time. Very professional and pleased me with on time and the attitude was good with humor. I will strongly recommend him,0
"Ya, delivery guy looks good and reached on time however he helped me with food but, not favourite food. i told him to do good on next time with favourite ingredient and smile face without any doubt ",0
I understand that there are few things which are not under the control of delivery person. I am rating delivery person high on delivery timing and respectfulness.,0
"Although the order was not as I expected, or wanted, the person who delivered the meal was professional and cheerful. They also apologized for the error, which helped a little.",0
The delivery person is courteous. The delivery person bought food on time. I was allergic to peanut butter so I think that this was not good on the part of the waiter to bring such an item.,0
Food delivered on the time without delay. So delivery person is very respectful. and honor. He did job good and neat. If I receive same order on same time i will get more happy.,0
"yes my order is timely arrive, this man is a such good person, but restaurent who take my order that person is not good man. he also negleted person, he is not a son of a pig",0
I dint care of that .I am complaint about who preparation of the product which is the person will give the answer because of order knowledge is gone out  ,0
even though the person delivers the product on time.i would definitely consider the traffic for late delivery otherwise i would not satisfy for late delivery   ,0
The irder i had made was delevired on time and the delivery person was nice and respectful. Nothing out of the ordinary to report on about the delivery itself,0
" quality of food, quality of service, atmosphere and design of resturant...it is clean and smells good, servers attentive and knowledgeable consider presentation, how it was prepared, how good it looks. Then the taste ",0
I think that the delivery person may of handed me the wrong order.  What I got was completely different than from what I ordered.   I hope in the future this wont happen again. ,1
The delivery person was on time. Food arrived hot and promptly! I would use their service again. I am very happy with using this company. My order was wrong but this is not at the fault or control of the delivery driver. ,0
"The delivery person was on time and polite, which is really all one can ask for when it comes to delivery. The meal itself was terrible, but that was beyond his control.",0
"The driver was prompt and nice enough.  I would use them again.  I had no complaints with the driver per se, just the fact that my order was ruined by the restaurant. ",0
The delivery aspect of my order was fine. The driver arrived on time and I didn't have any issues with that. I had a major problem with my order but I don't think it was the fault of the delivery driver. ,0
"I appreciate the driver bringing me my food today, as I could not leave my present location. They delivered the food presented to them from the restaurant, and even though the restaurant did make mistakes, the driver did their duty. The driver was respectful and on time. ",0
The delivery from GrubHub was good.  The product was delivered on time and the driver was very courteous.  No issues with the GrubHub delivery.  I would give this delivery driver 5 stars.,0
"The delivery person was very professional and I was pleased with them. They arrived on time and didn't keep me waiting in limbo for my order, which I very much appreciate. ",0
Did a great job with traffic and got my food to me on a timely manner. Very nice person and was very professional at what he does. A good driver and someone that you can count on.,0
The restaurant is responsible for the wrong delivery and it was not the delivery boys mistake. I placed my order according to my taste but the restaurant sent me the wrong one which Iam allergic to.,0
The delivery person was great!  Unfortunately the restaurant got my meal wrong which was not the delivery person's fault.  I would use the delivery service again but maybe not with this restaurant,0
Everything was fine with the delivery person. It isn't their fault that my food was messed up. They did their job just fine as far as I am concerned. ,0
The delivery person for my order was fine. They were timely with my delivery and it wasn't damaged. The delivery person was on time and respectful. I would use this delivery person again if I could.,0
She was very kind and courteous and my order was on time. If I have to rate just on that she was good and I would use her again.  Even though my order was wrong but that's not her fault. ,0
"I did have some issues with my order, but that was because the restaurant did not prepare my food correctly.  The delivery person was great, though.  He was on time, and he was very courteous with me after I became upset that my order was wrong.",0
"I got my order but it was not what I wanted. Not sure who to blame for that, but I guess the delivery was at least completed. There needs to be more oversight.",0
"While my order was wrong, the delivery person did deliver on time and it did arrive in the way it should have, all considering. I know some factors are out of the delivery persons control so I can't ding him for mistakes that he didn't make directly.",0
"The delivery person was fine. They did their job, as expected and was on time with it. My issues are with the order itself (From the place I ordered it from and how they messed up.) However, the delivery itself was flawless.",0
"The delivery person was respectful and on time. My order was all wrong and it wasn't his fault, but he told me he would do what he could to help fix it. No complaints about him!",0
"Assuming it was not the delivery person's fault, the restaurant is likely entirely to blame for this situation. If the cook was not paying attention, for example, it could have gotten messed up.",0
The delivery person was professional and on time.  I do think though that the delivery people should double check the order before leaving the restaurant with said order.,1
This delivery person was excellent.  The food was delivered quickly and the delivery person was very pleasant.  They are a great representation of the company and I will be using the company again solely for the impression that I got from the delivery person. ,0
The delivery person was on time and pleasant.  My food arrived hot and quickly even though it was the height of the lunch rush hour.  For speedy delivery of food no matter where you are I would recommend using this delivery person.,0
The order was on time. The delivery person was respectful and nice. I have no complaints. He did the job that he was supposed to do. The service was exactly as expected. Everything was fine with the delivery service and I would use the delivery service again. I would recommend it. ,0
"The delivery driver from GrubHub was on-time, even given that it was the lunchtime rush. We spoke for a few seconds in a friendly conversation even though he had several other deliveries to make.",0
"The delivery driver was great and did their job. The restaurant is the one who made an error and made it so I could not eat my lunch. I have a nut allergy and ordered my meal without a peanut spread, yet my food was covered in peanut butter. Again, great job by the driver, they did what they were supposed to do.",0
"The delivery person was fine, the order came on time and they were courteous. My issue is not with the delivery person but with the way my order was erroneously prepared, which could have really impacted my health. I am very dissatisfied with the service, not the delivery person.",0
"It was a typical delivery one would expect. It arrived on time and the driver was polite and courteous. However, the food was not the exact food that I ordered and as a result I will probably not be using grubhub anymore.",0
