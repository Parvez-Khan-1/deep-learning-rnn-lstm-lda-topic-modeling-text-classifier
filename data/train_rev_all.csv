The delivery was not at all aduquate.  They messed up my order and brought me food that I was allergic too.  I am very disappointed in the service they provided.  ,1
My delivery person did not check my order and the order was completely wrong for me. This should never have been delivered to me as is and it should have been checked.,1
The delivery person was professional and on time.  I do think though that the delivery people should double check the order before leaving the restaurant with said order.,1
She brought me food with an allergen in it and I was unable to eat because of that. Driver's really need to check orders before leaving the restaurant and delivering the food. ,1
I think that the delivery person may of handed me the wrong order.  What I got was completely different than from what I ordered.   I hope in the future this wont happen again. ,1
Bad experience ever happen in my life all day hungry .The food i ordered was not delivery by u is this your way of customer care. Once check all item is in ordered by the Clint  ,1
The delivery person was not very good. They messed up my order in a way that made it not let me have food for lunch because of their mistake. I would never use their service again.,1
It was a normal delivery although they didn't seem to order the food the way I asked them too. Not that big of a deal for me but I can't see myself using Grubhub anymore after this.,1
"I know it's probably the restaurant's fault and not the driver, but I'm mad that he didn't realize that the order was wrong. I had to throw the whole meal out and couldn't eat any of it.",1
"I am totally upset with the order, you are not all understood my order and this is worst delivery which i got in my life. I am allergic to peanet butter and you didnt offered me the good meal.",1
This deliverer was nice and all. I just hated that they didn't even have the decency to check and make sure my order was right before bringing it to me. I feel like that's part of the job too. ,1
"He was on time and I dont have complaint on his timing, but what have he checked while lifting the items for delivery. Should be not check with the ordered and to be delivered items in the bill. ",1
"The delivery person did not seem to care. The order was very badly destroyed, and the one reason I ordered it was ignored. The delivery person also took far too much time to deliver it, so it wound up late.",1
"The delivery person did not make sure that my order was correct before leaving the restaurant.  I had specified no peanut butter and my order contained peanut butter.  Due to my allergy, I could not eat the meal.",1
My delivery person did not check to make sure the food was as ordered before delivering it. They forgot to leave off the peanut butter spread so I was unable to eat it due to my nut allergy. Such a disappointment! ,1
The delivery person did not bring me the right item. I do not kind though cause I know those apps can be confusing and perhaps the app itself did not register the order in the way I intended. Oh well. I will live. ,1
"I was unable to get my order right. Half of the items were wasted because of this and the allergies I have. I wish that my driver would have checked the order, that is why I use the service in the first place. Useless.",1
"It is really a bitter experience with your delivery style. I will not say, that the delivery was late.  But you people have delivered some that of your choice and not what I have ordered. It seems you have done it deliberately.",1
This is my first time using the app.  I believe I was delivered the wrong meal.  It could of been a accident or it could of been incompetence.  I am unsure which it is but I got something totally different than what I ordered. ,1
I was very disappointed with this order.  My food was inedible and there was nothing that I could do.  I would not have food delivered again.  I think the delivery person should have checked my order to make sure that it was correct.,1
"I am very unhappy with my order. Although I got it on time, it was entirely wrong. I could not eat some items because they didn't follow my order directions and gave me the wrong one, and I'm allergic. The driver should have checked.",1
This person couldn't even check my order to make sure that it was right before bringing it to me. Everything was completely wrong and I have no way of getting a new meal because I spent the last of my money on this one. Horrible service. ,1
"This delivery person clearly does not care about the instructions given with orders. My food came without the main ingredient, which is the whole reason I wanted it, and it was covered in peanut butter when I specifically requested no peanut butter.",1
"I had some issues with my order and wish the delivery person had checked it to make sure it matched. However, they are ultimately not the one that made the mistake. The order was prompt, delivery person was nice and friendly, and everything went smoothly with them.",1
"The delivery person from Grub Hub did not do a good job.  I felt like that she was not attentive to the instructions that I provided.  My order was wrong on several different levels.  Consider a different delivery person when going Grub Hub, not one you can rely on.",1
I am pretty upset about my order. I specifically asked to not have peanut butter on it as I am allergic to peanuts. When I opened up my order it was covered in peanut butter. I am now out of cash and hungry :(. The delivery person obviously was not paying attention to orders!,1
"I was very displeased at the fact taht my food had peanut butter scattered all about. I am allergic and the driver seemed not to care that all this was splashed over my food. What might seem small to the delivery service is something actually quite big to me, and dangerous. I am upset. ",1
"The delivery person was careless. She should have checked to make sure that the order was prepared as ordered before delivering it. Even though the mistake with the order may not have been her fault, it is still her responsibility to verify that the delivery is what the customer ordered.",1
"So I got my order from today.  The food was timely and I got it in a reasonable manner.  However, the order was completely wrong.  I am not sure if the problem was hers or it was due to the place I ordered from, but I know as a former deliver person, you always check the order before you leave. ",1
"While my delivery person was on time and very courteous, my order arrived with a couple of major issues.  I wish that the delivery person would have verified that my order was correct before bringing it to me.  Now I have wasted my money on a meal that I canâ€™t eat because I am allergic to the ingredients.",1
"The meal was just completely ruined for me! My delivery person forgot a very important ingredient which was the whole reason I look forward to this specific meal. I also asked for no peanut spread because I'm very allergic with nuts, and the meal came full of peanut spread! I will never trust this service again.",1
"I used the delivery service Grubgrab and got the wrong meal. I think the driver should be checking the meal when it is picked up, just like I would before I drive home. I think that otherwise the dinner was delivered just fine. But next time I'll do a reminder that to check the meal and you might all want to do that too.",1
"The delivery person provided bad service. She delivered the order without checking that it had been prepared the way the customer ordered it. The mistake on the preparation was probably a mistake the chef or whoever prepared the order made, but the delivery person is at fault for not checking that the order was prepared correctly.",1
"The delivery was not what I wanted. I tried to tell the delivery person this, but they didn't seem the slightest bit interested in what I had to say. At the very least they should have apologized for messing the order up! No apology was offered. I am thoroughly disgusted with this service. Needless to say, I will not be using your service again. ",1
"This delivered meal was completely  wrong.  I am so upset and will not use this service again!  not only was my order wrong, but it came with a peanut spread, when I am allergic to nuts so I  could not eat the meal due to this, forcing me to go  the entire day without lunch.  I would never recommend them to any of my friends or colleagues at this point.  I'm very disappointed with the guy who delivered my order.",1
"I only have an allotted amount of time for lunch, so when I order lunch I can't afford it to have any mistakes! My order today had peanut butter in it which I am highly allergic to. To make matters worse, it was missing the one thing that I was really looking forward to eating and specifically ordered. I would never order from here again. Their delivery people obviously are careless and the company isn't concerned about us customers.",1
"Today I am very disappointed with the delivery to say the least. Although I can't completely blame the delivery driver since they didn't physically make the food, however I think it is their responsibility to check that they have picked up the correct food and to see if there are any errors to the best of their ability. My meal today wasn't slightly wrong - it was completely wrong! And now I am unable to even eat lunch today because of this.",1
"I am very upset with my service. First, I have allergies to peanuts and my food contained peanut butter - this is something that delivery drivers should check before delivering the food. They should always be checking that the food matches the order exactly, and thats even more important when allergies are involved. Second, it was missing the 1 item I was really looking forward to! Again, had the driver checked, I would have had my full meal. ",1
The delivery person brought my meal but it was the wrong meal. I would have preferred the delivery driver to check to make sure the correct meal was given up them to deliver. I understand mistakes can happen but I was unable to eat the meal due to an allergy and also it did not contain what I ordered. I had to go through the day without lunch because the driver was careless and did not check the order. I am very disappointed with this service.,1
The delivery person brought my meal but it was the wrong meal. I would have preferred the delivery driver to check to make sure the correct meal was given up them to deliver. I understand mistakes can happen but I was unable to eat the meal due to an allergy and also it did not contain what I ordered. I had to go through the day without lunch because the driver was careless and did not check the order. I am very disappointed with this service.,1
"My meal was completely messed up by the restaurant.  I'm allergic to nuts and asked for NO peanut spread - however my meal was covered in and and I cannot eat it at all.  I also ordered the special because I absolutely love this one ingredient in the dish - and they didn't even include that ingredient!  While the delivery person is not at fault, the restaurant definitely is!  And I think the delivery person should have checked my order before accepting it.",1
"I am not sure who is in charge of making sure that my meal is correct, but I feel as if the delivery person should of been able to put in their part to check my food. I am allergic to peanut butter and my meal was smeared with peanut butter. I also ordered from this specific restaurant because I wanted to get a very specific meal, but the meal came with out the ingredient that I wanted. I believe that the delivery person should make sure that meals are delivered accordingly.",1
"I am very unhappy with my experience today. I had ordered from this place for a specific ingredient and it was forgotten! I also specified no peanut butter, as I am allergic to nuts, and it came with peanut butter all over it! This is unacceptable. It is the responsibility of the deliver person to make sure they are delivering the right meal! This did not happen, and I could not eat any of the meal that I had paid for. So disappointed and angry at the incompetent delivery person, who brought me food, without checking it first, that I cannot eat! ",1
"While this is not the fault of the delivery person entirely, it still makes me quite angry that he/she did not double check my order, and so I ended up getting my food delivered without my favorite ingredient - which is why I ordered it in the first place! And to make matters worse, it came with peanut butter spread and I am ALLERGIC to nuts.  So, I ended up not being able to eat my meal and went without lunch altogether! By far the worst experience I have had with a delivery service platform in my entire life. I will not ever use again, nor do I recommend anyone using them! Awful experience. ",1
Everything was fine with the delivery person. It isn't their fault that my food was messed up. They did their job just fine as far as I am concerned. ,0
"The food was fucking atrocious. I've eaten ass that tasted better, but the driver was good. He was quick and polite which is all you can really expect.",0
Delivery person from Grubhub was pretty good. He arrived fairly fast and came to the front desk at my work. He confirmed my order and was very pleasant. ,0
I dint care of that .I am complaint about who preparation of the product which is the person will give the answer because of order knowledge is gone out  ,0
"The delivery person was fine. I want the person who prepared the meal fired. Take away their salary, put them in the poorhouse. It's the right thing to do.",0
He is good and delivered the meal on time. Very professional and pleased me with on time and the attitude was good with humor. I will strongly recommend him,0
I think the delivery person was fine and the delivery was prompt. Just the food was messed up. I would use the delivery person again as they are not to blame.,0
The irder i had made was delevired on time and the delivery person was nice and respectful. Nothing out of the ordinary to report on about the delivery itself,0
"The delivery person was average, no issues with them. There was nothing extraordinary or terrible about them. He was friendly as expected of a delivery driver.",0
"I got my order but it was not what I wanted. Not sure who to blame for that, but I guess the delivery was at least completed. There needs to be more oversight.",0
"Although my order was a mess, The delivery person got my food to me in a timely manner and was professional. I'm happy with the service of the delivery person. ",0
even though the person delivers the product on time.i would definitely consider the traffic for late delivery otherwise i would not satisfy for late delivery   ,0
I understand that there are few things which are not under the control of delivery person. I am rating delivery person high on delivery timing and respectfulness.,0
The delivery person arrived on time and was polite. I could not ask for more as far as the delivery service goes but the food aspect of my order was totally wrong.,0
"This delivery person was satisfactory. The food was not what I had asked for, but that wasn't his fault. He was on time and held up his end of the deal fairly well.",0
The delivery person was professional and he was on-time. But food was bad and my instructions were ignored. I could just say that the the delivery guy is not at fault.,0
"I got the order on time and he was friendly and nice. I would recommend this person to deliver the food to me again, did a great job at what he does. Very responsible.",0
"The driver was prompt and nice enough.  I would use them again.  I had no complaints with the driver per se, just the fact that my order was ruined by the restaurant. ",0
"This restaurant is so bad! The delivery person gave me the right food, but without the correct specifications. They also took my money, but I wasn't able to eat my meal!",0
The delivery person was prompt and nice.  I am happy with the service he provided and would be happy to have him deliver my food again.   He seems like a people person. ,0
The food was not good but the delivery person was respectful and did bring my order on time.  I was not happy with the whole process but that was not the driver's fault.,0
"The delivery person was on time and polite, which is really all one can ask for when it comes to delivery. The meal itself was terrible, but that was beyond his control.",0
"As far as delivery, the delivery came on time and the delivery person was nice and polite. I have no problems there, but the meal was totally messed up by the restaurant.",0
"i didnt get my meal in time The biggest mistake people make is feedingmy self and trying to get somthing to eat. Home brand, an expensive brand, whatever. It is all bad. ",0
My delivery person brought me my meal on time. They were very professional and did their job well. They did a good job and did everything that could be expected of them. ,0
What a prompt and great delivery person!  They were quick to get my food to me.  Once they were here they were so polite and gave correct change without a blink of an eye.,0
"The delivery person was very professional and I was pleased with them. They arrived on time and didn't keep me waiting in limbo for my order, which I very much appreciate. ",0
"Order was wrong and do to allergies could not even eat it. Lost money and didn't get to eat. Waste of money and time, would have been better off going to get the food myself.",0
"The delivery person was fine. They did their job, as expected and was on time with it. My neutral is due to the fact the order was messed up and inedible in its current form.",0
"yes my order is timely arrive, this man is a such good person, but restaurent who take my order that person is not good man. he also negleted person, he is not a son of a pig",0
"Although the order was not as I expected, or wanted, the person who delivered the meal was professional and cheerful. They also apologized for the error, which helped a little.",0
Food delivered on the time without delay. So delivery person is very respectful. and honor. He did job good and neat. If I receive same order on same time i will get more happy.,0
"The delivery person was respectful and on time. My order was all wrong and it wasn't his fault, but he told me he would do what he could to help fix it. No complaints about him!",0
"The food was fucking atrocious. I've eaten ass that tasted better, but the delivery driver was good. He was quick and polite. I will never order from the restaurant again though.",0
Delivery arrived on time. Order was inaccurate but that's not his fault. No problems with delivery to report. Would recommend but not for restaurants that can't get orders right.,0
"I don't get how someone can mess up an idea this bad. I mean, it's really simple instructions and yet it was really wrong, even though I stated what I didn't want on it!! Awful...",0
"The order was on time and the delivery person was nice. Sadly, my order was completely wrong. i could not eat it because I am allergic to nuts. I would not use this service again.",0
Did a great job with traffic and got my food to me on a timely manner. Very nice person and was very professional at what he does. A good driver and someone that you can count on.,0
I specifically asked for no peanut butter because I am allergic to that and I got that in my meal. I was unable to eat this because of my allergy. I am very disappointed and upset.,0
that person was quite nice.his delivery approach is very good.he was on a time to deliver.such a nice person to do work like this. i would prefer these kind of persons to the companies,0
"The delivery person was very respectful, and did his/her job quite well. Even though I wasn't satisfied with the food, I did appreciate the quality of service from the delivery person.",0
"I must say that the delivery driver was on time and respectful and at the end of her day it shouldn't be her fault, but I am upset my food is covered in peanut sauce when I am allergic. ",0
"The person who delivered the food was great, the order was wrong, but that is on the restaurant.  I will be taking this up with the restaurant, but it is not the delivery person's fault. ",0
The delivery from GrubHub was good.  The product was delivered on time and the driver was very courteous.  No issues with the GrubHub delivery.  I would give this delivery driver 5 stars.,0
"The driver chose a route with heavy traffic and the subsequent delay increased my fare quite considerably. Due to the delay, I was very late for work.",1
Iâ€™m very unhappy with the service and will be immediately unsubscribing soon.  The driver made me very late for my functions and Iâ€™d like an incentive.,1
I should be very careful with that driver. He ia a waste person. That driver is not an opt person for driving. I must complaint about him to that office.,1
Car was clean and he was perfectly respectful but the route he took wasn't ideal so I'd guess he isnt familiar with the area and had to rely solely on GPS,1
"Awful. The driver made me 45 minutes late for one of my meetings and I lost my contract because of it. Not only that he charged a huge rate for the ""service.""",1
"The driver was respectful and the car was clean. However, I wish the driver would have looked ahead at the traffic forecast on GPS and taken a different route. ",1
The driver did not know the optimal routes to take and because of this carelessness he made me late for an important meeting bad driver caused a lot of headache!,1
I had a very bad experience. The driver took a high traffic route and I reached 45 minutes late. I am extremely disappointed. This driver must be banned by Uber. ,1
"Regardless of the driver's intentions, the driver showed severe incompetence while driving. This driver essentially ruined my life. This driver deserves punishment.",1
"The driver took a very poor route, causing a 45 minute delay and making me miss an important work meeting. Not the type of service I'm used to when taking rideshare.",1
The ride was subpar. The driver took a route which resulted in me arriving to work 45 minutes late. This is a paid service. I should have received better for my money.,1
"This was a horrible ride. The driver took a long way to my destination making me late for work and missing an important meeting, and the drive ended up costing me more.",1
"I would NOT recommend this driver. He took the longest route in traffic, resulting in me being late to my meeting. On top of that, I had to pay a huge fee for my drive!",1
The driver took a route with a lot of traffic and made me late for work which made me miss a meeting and my boss yelled at me I am ver dissatisfied with the service booo.,1
The driver knew that this route had a lot of traffic but used it anyways. The driver made no attempt to change to a faster route which would have saved me time and money.,1
The bad traffic and high price made me late to work. This resulted in a huge negative impact that I perceive to be the fault of the driver. I wouldn't ride with him again.,1
The ride took so long because the driver took a different route with a heavy traffic. I had to deal with lots of serious consequences because of the driver's route choice.,1
"Although the traffic congestion was not the driver's fault, he did end up charging me a very high price. He could have checked the road conditions in advance, but he didn't. ",1
"Extremely unhappy with the route taken by the driver. It wasn't optimized and as a result not only did we hit massive traffic, I ended up paying much more for the longer ride.",1
the driver took much longer than expected. the driver took a route that had heavy traffic which caused me to miss my appointment and pay extra for the ride. very bad experience.,1
He's routeing method is very poor i feel very upset today only reason for this Trip. He took long minute to drive. If i am went to my by walk i will reach quickly then this Ride,1
This is the absolute worst driver in existence. This driver's errors caused me serious problems both personally and professionally. I am furious and this driver should be banned.,1
They just didnt seem to know what they were doing. They took a long route that took way too long and that lead to me being yelled at and having to pay for all with a lot of money,1
This driver is terrible. He uses the longest route and you end up paying more than you should. I ended up late for work and in trouble with my boss. He should find a different job.,1
"Took the long way, got stuck in traffic. Missed important stuff at work. Would not use. This driver is horrible at his job. I want my money back, had to pay a lot for this crap ride.",1
THE DRIVER WAS UNPOLITE AND USED AN UNUSUAL ROUTE. HE ALSO CHARGED AN ENORMOUS AMOUNT FOR HIS SERVICE. HE SHOULD DEVELOP THESE QUALITIES TO MAINTAIN A BETTER CAREER IN HIS PROFESSION.,1
The car was clean and the driver was also nice but I was still late for my meeting. I think he could have done a better job of driving and paying more attention to the road to be honest,1
The driver should be able to tell which route is clean by his GPS route. He took a route with a heavy traffic which made me to lose important meetings because of the 45 mins traffic delay.,1
The driver was late and charged Alice premium to drive her.  Alice was late to an important meeting.  Alice used the drive app like Uber and was asked to provide a feedback on the driver.  ,1
I would say this driver just simply didn't do a good enough job of helping me with routes and time management. I think this is all easily avoidable with technology that they refused to use.,1
I am very unhappy with my ride service. The driver took a high traffic route and we were delayed 45 minutes. I was late to a business appointment. I doubt I'll use this drive service again.,1
Terrible driver. Could have used GPS or something to find a better route and avoid the traffic. I got in serious trouble at work all from the route that was taken.  Please avoid this driver.,1
"He purposefully chose a longer route. We got stuck in traffic, and the bill was very high. Because of his actions I missed a very important meeting. Would not recommend using his services again. ",1
I am beyond pissed. This driver took a ridiculous route causing a 45min delay and had the nerve to overcharge me on it! I was late for work and obviously my boss was not pleased. Thanks a lot Uber. ,1
The driver chose a bad route that delayed me by about 45 minutes. I would not recommend using this driver. They certainly could have picked a better route so that I would not have been late to work.,1
"I feel that the driver did the best that they could given the circumstances. There is nothing to really sway my review to either side, it was simply a normal trip, yet unfortunately in heavy traffic.",1
The driver simply did not use great reasoning skills. In running into such traffic he could have chosen a different street but he didn't. We sat there stuck as if there was no other way to get around. ,1
The driver took a route that was backed up. As a result I lost a client and got reprimanded by my boss. I wish the driver took a different route but I cannot fully blame the driver for traffic being busy.,1
Uber should have strict rules before accepting new drivers. I had a really terrible experience last time. The driver lacked basic understanding of the route and traffic and I was very late to the meeting. ,1
"Although the driver has no control of the factors above it causes loss to me so I had a bad opinion on the driver,moreover he charged me a higher price which he can reduce on his part but he failed to do so.",1
The cleanliness was not good i don't like the cleanliness but the driving is good and i like it with almost every good liking with the travel the travel experience is good and has good experience in the travel,1
"This is not working out.  The driver was late 45 minutes and made me miss an important meeting. On top of all this, I was charged the premium.  I want my money back and I do not want to use this driver again.  ",1
"Horrible driver, took a poor route, made me late for work. missed a big meeting, boss is super mad at me. This Uber driver has potentially gotten me fired from work. Think twice before getting into this guys car.",1
"The driver took a route that resulted in me being late for work. She should have taken a route that had a lot less traffic, although it is sometimes difficult to predict which routes will be buys at various times.",1
This ride was unacceptable. He took a longer route instead of the quickest. Because of this I missed a major meeting and lost a contract for work. I am furious. Drivers should know the quickest most efficient routes.  ,1
"The driver took a route that resulted in me being late for work.  Even though there was a lot of traffic, she still remained courteous and understanding of my lateness to work. She will try to make it better next time.",1
"I'm extremely unhappy with my driver because he took the way with the most traffic, cost me a lot of money, and made me super late for a meeting and I even got yelled at by my boss. I'm not happy and this driver is just bad. ",1
Unfortunately this driver isn't good at navigating the best routes. I was 45 minutes later than I intended and ended up getting into a lot of trouble at work because of it. Do not recommend this person if you're on a schedule.,1
"This driver was late to pick up and didn't even apologize for it. I ended up being 45 minutes late for work, which could have been prevented if this driver had taken a better route. Overall I would not recommend this driver to anyone!",1
"This was an extremely disappointing and unsatisfactory experience.  The ride cost more than it should have, and the route used was highly sub optimal, causing me to be late for a very important meeting. Would not recommend this driver.",1
"i  am very disspointed by the driver,he used a longer route and i really got late for work because the traffic was very big.i missed my meeting which was very important and my boss was not happy about it.i plan not to use this service again.",1
the experience with the driver was very terrible and it cost me my job. he doesnt know the routes which will be short and time efficient. the journey was suppose to be 10 minutes and he drove me nearly an hour and i lost everything in my job.,1
"Driver was either incompetent or scamming me. They took a very bad route that delayed me by 45 minutes. There was a ton of traffic, and I was late to work, which had extremely bad consequences for me. Will not be using this service ever again.",1
"My driver had some serious issues and I would not recommend. The driver took a terrible route and caused me to be late for an important meeting. After this inconvenience, the fare was extremely high and the driver refused to issue me a refund. ",1
"Driver took me down a poor route that was choked with traffic. I ended up being very late for a very important meeting. On top of that, I got charged a lot more than I should have been because the ride took so long.   I'm very upset about this.",1
"Again i think, the driver might have done best from technical point of view, the delay cause business loss of alice. The driver could offer apology for delay or overcharge by company. Then it could be consider as a one of the forgivable instances.",1
I think the driver should take more charge of being able to help the situation without the technology babysitting him every step of the way. This cost me a lot of time and a chance at a job interview that I have to reschedule because of this driver.,1
"He could have taken a better route. In the end, the commute took a lot longer than it should have and thus cost me a lot more than it should have as well. The car was clean and the driver was kind, but that doesn't make him the most competent driver.",1
My driver caused me to be late for work. It was not a good experience as we got caught in traffic. I also think that the driver could have taken a different route and got me to work on time. I missed an important meeting and it cost me a lot of money.,1
"The review took 45 minutes longer than they should have to get to my destination. Because of that, my contract was cancelled and I am severely impaired at my work because of it. Poor judge of character for this man. I hope he gets it straightened out.",1
this driver did not get me where i needed to go instead he took me the long route and got me stuck in traffic and I missed my most important meeting what an awful driver he should never be allowed to drive again and that's what I have to say about it ,1
this driver did not get me where i needed to go instead he took me the long route and got me stuck in traffic and I missed my most important meeting what an awful driver he should never be allowed to drive again and that's what I have to say about it ,1
"This joker took the worst possible route. I mean THE worst possible, which resulted in me A) being late, B) Losing a client, C) being charged a ridiculous price because the driver can't read Google maps and, D) my day being ruined. Worst Uber driver ever.  ",1
"The driver is unprofessional,took a longer distance.He is disrespectful towards the customers and took almost 45 mins late to my destination by taking a route which is full  with traffic.Moreover they charge a high price on the ride.I never recommend this driver.",1
"Overall, I am very dissatisfied with the ride I received. The driver took a bad route with a ton of traffic which resulted in a very long delay, causing me to be late to work. It also caused the price of the ride to be excessively high. I would avoid this driver in the future.",1
"My driver was terrible. He was definitely not familiar with the route, or he just wanted to overcharge me. The commute took forever because of his choices. I was late for work because of this driver. I hope he loses his job because he is an idiot. He cost my company and I a lot today. ",1
"It was very important that I get to work on time for an important meeting. The driver was courteous, but took a route that was crowded with traffic.  They didn't try to find an alternate route.  I ended up paying a super high fee for the drive and was 45 mins late.  Totally unacceptable.",1

"The driver took a route which was completely jammed with traffic. This was not the route I expected and I was completely frustrated. This route took much longer, making me late. The driver had the nerve to charge me way more than I expected to pay, I would not ride with this driver again.",1
"As someone who drives for a living, this driver should have know the best routes for this time. Instead they ignored this. Taking a path with a lot of traffic, causing me to be late 45 minutes, miss a meeting and get overcharged. I believe they did this simply so they could charge me more.",1
My own driver is such a good person. He will always drive safely. He will not talk much during driving. He will follow and obey all the traffic rules. ,0
Dissappointed with my ride. Wish the driver tried harder to get me to work on time. Really hope to not experience this type of ride again in the future. ,0
"The car was clean and the driver was nice, but i was still late for work and that isn't acceptable to me. This is more of an issue with the service itself. ",0
the driver was polite and the car was good. the route was all messed up and i don't know whose fault it was. it wasn't mine. i rated neutral because of this.,0
"The driver was courteous, and could tell I was concerned about the length of the trip and how long it was taking. They tried to make the trip a pleasant one.",0
"The driver was courteous, and could tell I was concerned about the length of the trip and how long it was taking. They tried to make the trip a pleasant one.",0
Very disappointed with my ride. I was very late to work which resulted in very bad consequences. Hope to not have an experience like this again in the future.,0
Took too long and route was filled with traffic. Very frustrating and the price of the trip was a lot more than I expected for the ride. I wouldn't recommend.,0
This driver was professional enough. The car was nice and they were polite. I guess there were some factors outside of their control but they handled it well.,0
"Uber assigned the driver a route with heavy traffic and the subsequent delay increased my fare quite considerably. Due to the delay, I was very late for work.",0
Not very happy but probably not the fault of her but of the company.  I was late and was charged a bunch but Stuff happens and she was not the one charginig met. ,0
"there was unexpected traffic and the drive took much longer than expected. however, the car and driver was pleasant excluding the unforeseen issues we encountered.",0
Driver and his car were very nice i'm unhappy with the price of the ride and route taken. this is ubers fault not the driver! You suck i want a refund!! seriously!!,0
Driver was friendly and courteous during the ride. It took 45 minutes to get to where I was going causing me to lose a contract but that can't be totally blamed on him. ,0
The driver kept a clean car and was very nice to me during the ride. He was nice to talk to. I appreciated this kind of service. I would definitely recommend this driver. ,0
Tough time but not drivers fault.  We had some traffic issues and the rates were out of this world but I konw that is not my uber drivers fual just the fault of the system. ,0
the driver is make their travel very safety and clean their car very perfect and the check back all the parts of the vehicle.  It is very necessary to the driver's profession,0
The car was clean and I understand that the driver was respectful  I was late for work because of traffic so I missed an important meeting and the ride cost me a lot of money.,0
"The ride was average. I did not get there in time. But, it was no fault of my driver. I am still disappointed by the service.                                                   ",0
The driver was respectful during the ride and the vehicle was clean inside. Given my understanding of what is or isn't in the driver's control I'd say this driver did a good job.,0
 I must add that the driver was very respectful and nice. I noticed that the car was clean and there was no trash laying around. I can also acknowledge the GPS routes arenâ€™t perfect.,0
I had no issues with the driver.  He was just fine and did his job.  I got there late but that was the traffic to blame.  He had no control over it.  I got to where I needed to go.  ,0
I had a long ride with this driver. There was a lot of traffic and delays. The driver however was polite and the car was clean. I had no problems with the driver's manners or the car.,0
"I don't know if it's the driver's or Uber's fault, but a route was selected with extremely high traffic. The trip took longer than it should and led to very serious consequences for me.",0
the ride was taken for too long time and the driver guided with the gps doesnt have any alternative routes to avoid the traffics. though he was polite and the car was in good condition.,0
The route they took could have been better. It led to me being late and having to pay a high price for all of that as well. I was then yelled at when I got to work because of all of this. ,0
Good Driver but today is my worst day of my life. But he also make some mistake one little street they take right if he take left on the i soonly reach my office. but any way driving is good,0
The driver was very friendly and respectful during the whole ride. There was nothing the driver could have really done and i guess it was just all due to bad luck that we were stuck in traffic.,0
The drive to work was fine except for the fact that I was stuck in traffic for 45 minutes which caused me to be late. The driver was nice and it's not his fault that the gps took us on that route.,0
"The car was clean and the driver was polite.  I think he followed the standard route to my destination. But traffic was very heavy on our route, took much longer than usual,  I wish he had warned me.",0
I am satisfied with my drive service. While the traffic was bad and we arrived to our destination 45 minutes late. The car was clean and the driver was respectful throughout the duration of the ride. ,0
The driver was nice and respectful during the car ride. I also appreciated the fact that the vehicle was clean. It is hard to overlook that they chose a route that was so backed up and I was quite late.,0
"No. Screw you. You aren't paying me enough to write essays for you, you cheap creep. Go fuck yourself. No. Screw you. You aren't paying me enough to write essays for you, you cheap creep. Go fuck yourself.",0
I was very unhappy with the overall service. I ended up 40 minutes late to my appointment and I am not thrilled.  I was billed more than I should have been because the ride took longer than it should have.,0
"While the car was clean and he was respectful, my ride wasn't very pleasant as I was considerably late to my destination. The company should improve their GPS routes to manage traffic better for customers.",0
"even though the driver was nice and the car was clean,i eventually was late for work by around 45 minutes.i was angry because i missed a lot at work,a very important meeting and i suffered a loss from this.",0
"This ride was awful. Its not the drivers fault, but the route he had to take was slow and made me late. I missed stuff at work and had to pay a lot for the ride. This company needs to get its act together. ",0
"The car was clean and the driver was very courteous and respectful, but they took a very poor route that ended up with us in a 45 minute traffic delay. Out of the drivers control, but poor routing nonetheless.",0
I didn't think this was a fair exchange of good for my money. The good being a ride service that would get me where I needed to go on time! I wasn't on time it was too expensive and I'm extremely dissappointed!,0
"one who is doing his driving work perfect they call as a perfect driver.  he is control the vehicle and drive properly in the way of their driving, go safe for their journey and get back to the passenger safely.",0
"Overall the ride was satisfactory. While I arrived late and the price of the ride was very high, the driver cannot control these factors. That said, the car was clean and the other aspects of the service were good.",0
My driver was friendly and the car I rode in was clean. I ended up being late for work through no fault of the driver. I was charged what I believe is a high amount for the ride. All in all the driver is acceptable.,0
"THis app had my driver taking the longest route possible for what I can only assume was to be able to charge me a higher fee. The driver was awesome and the car was fresh and clean, but the company lacks any ethics.",0
"The actual driver was fine, and the car was clean, and he got me to my destination, but the route was longer than usual, and traffic was very heavy, resulting in me being very late for work and missing an important meeting.",0
"The ride sucked. We had to go through the very busy street which ate up almost 45 minutes. It wasn't his fault though the GPS gave bad directions and he didn't' know the street would be so busy. He was nice, the ride was not.",0
"The driver was fine. The car was clean and he was respectful. However, the system is bad, designed to get as much money as possible by taking terrible routes, getting you into traffic, etc. I won't be using this service again.",0
"I can't really blame the situation 100% on this driver, however I feel that some things could have been changed. We got stuck in traffic for 45 minutes. As a driver, you should anticipate traffic loads and find alternate routes. ",0
"The route went through a high traffic area and took way too long for what it should have. the fee was way too high and i was late to work. whether this was poor planning, coincidence or on purpose i don't know so i rated neutral.",0
"I had an unfortunate driving experience due to traffic and what I was charged, but these were beyond the driver's abilities to impact. On a positive note, he had a cleanly care that was pleasant to ride in, and he was a kind man.",0
"EVEN THOUGH THE TRAFFIC WAS VERY PEAK, THE DRIVER WAS VERY POLITE AND DO NOT RUSH OVER THE ROUTES. HE ALSO MAINTAIN HIS VEHICLE VERY GOOD. HE MAY KNOW SOME OF THE ALTERNATE ROUTES TO DROP EARLIER. IT COULD IMPROVE HIS PROFESSION.",0
The driver was nice. The rout took some time to get to result in negative consequences for me. I do not blame the driver for the heavy traffic. The car was clean and comfortable. I wish they had options to take alternative routes.,0
"The driver was okay, but due to the traffic and route, I arrived late to my destination and had to pay a huge fare. The driver was respectful and the car clean. I wish he could have taken a different route to avoid traffic though.",0
"The driver was nice and the car was clean. The route was a poor choice however. This led to serious problems with my job. While this is not the driver's direct fault, Uber should rectify their GPS to choose routes with less traffic.",0
"The traffic and GPS route is not the controllable thing that the driver can do, but he would have chosen a less traffic route to make the customers reach on time .Since the driver was respectful I had to forgo about the other issues.",0
The driver was very nice and very respectful. I was completely frustrated with the whole uber ride but I have to say the driver kept me calm and reassured me that everything would be fine. The car was clean and this driver was so nice.,0
"I am extremely frustrated with the lack of routes with this service. A poor route landed us in traffic, causing a lot of issues for me. But even more so, I feel overcharged. The driver, however, was kind and respectful and drove a clean car. ",0
"I'm very displeased with the service provided by this driver. They chose a route that took forever, cost me a lot of money, and delivered me to my destination very late. I think they did it deliberately, and maybe you shouldn't use them in the future.",0
"The high price that was charged was not fair. The ride took a lot longer then normal and I was still charged a high price. I know that the traffic wasn't the driver's fault, but there should be a price adjustment if the ride takes longer then average.",0
"The GPS route was wrong, the traffic was surprisingly brutal, and the rates are something that my driver couldn't control. That all being said, I think the driver could have kept me more updated so it could be possible to coordinate with my work sooner.",0
"We got stuck in some traffic, but I understand the driver does not control that. Perhaps the company should rethink its pricing rates if they go up while the customer suffers in traffic. Other than that the ride was fine and I don't have much to report.",0
The driver is good and the driving is good the speed limit he maintained the speed limit what expected and got a high and good manners he has but the price range is good and makes a quality diving experience in the travel at all i like the driving experience in the travel,0
"This driver did their best to pick me up on time, but there was considerable traffic which prevented that from happening. This being outside of the drivers control, I don't fault them for it. Besides that, the ride was good. The driver did the best they could with the circumstances.",0
"So my Uber ride did not go as planned.  There was a ton of traffic and it was really expensive.  At least my driver was courteous and the car was clean.  I guess it could have been worse.  I'll need to allow more time for traffic in the future when I have an important meeting, I guess.",0
"There were very difficult and trying circumstances during this particular ride that caused me to be late. I do not think it was all the driver's fault, but they would probably not be my first choice in the future, as they were not totally able to overcome these problems despite their efforts.",0
"The driver was fine, I'm super upset at Uber itself. Sent the driver on a bad route, causing me to be super late for work. My boss is pissed at me and I'm concerned I might lose my job because of something out of my drivers control. Think twice about using Uber when you need to be somewhere in a timely manner.",0
"Though the ride cost more than I was expecting and the GPS route caused me to be late to work, I have to say that the driver was really nice. He was so respectful and the car itself was clean. He was a good driver who got me there in safe condition. All in all, I was impressed with him regardless of the other factors.",0
I wasn't happy with the price because the traffic was bad which made me late and get into trouble with my job.  The price wasn't worth all that plus being late.  The driver had nothing to do with the traffic so he wasn't to blame but he picked the route that had a lot of traffic.  I just felt that I shouldn't have been charged so much. ,0
"The driver's car was clean and reasonably comfortable.  Unfortunately, I was so upset about being late that I really didn't pay too much attention to other aspects of the ride.  The driver was apologetic, but it didn't seem all that sincere.  While I know there were many things out of his control, I still wouldn't want to ride with him again.",0
"I'd like to think that this was not entirely the drivers fault, and I am trying to maintain my patience here, but this really makes me want to stop using this ride sharing service.  I don't know if I will be able to have faith in this kind of service again after my experience with getting to work so late today.  Hopefully next time the ride is exceptionally good.",0
"I recently took a ride with this driver, and I was pretty unsatisfied with my experience overall, though I will admit that some of it wasn't his fault. He took a route that went through heavy traffic, causing me to be late to work and lose an important client. The price I paid was also hefty, despite the unnecessarily long ride duration. Overall, I feel bad about the experience, though I realize some of it wasn't up to the driver.",0
"They did not finish the essay. There were technical difficulties and part of the end was cut off. Also, they submitted work right before the deadline.",1
"While this worker is capable of completing assignments, they cannot be relied on to meet deadlines. Errors and a lack of quality control can be expected.",1
"I am very dissapointed with the work I received.  Part of the last part was not done correctly, so even though the other part was good, the job is ruined.",1
She should of let me know my report was not 100% done. This made me look very stupid and not well off with my clinents which made me lose money in the end.,1
"Although the worker may have been respectful, the work he submitted cost the client. The client should be of primary concern and was failed by the worker. ",1
She is unprofessional.She just can't make deadlines or produce quality work.She is a drag to the platform she represents                                    ,1
Worker completed the task on time but the quality was sub-par. The final product was not checked for quality and the submission turned out to be incomplete.,1
"I didn't have the most positive experience with this worker. They met the deadline, but just barely. I wish they had been a little more quick with the work.",1
I wish the worker would have spent more time reviewing his or her work.  I feel like this simple error could have been caught had they proof read their work.,1
"This user took advantage of the fact that they knew I do not speak their language, and returned incomplete work that cost me an important business opportunity!",1
the worker cannot complete his work on time.he has poor writting skills.he cannot beat deadlines and he does not pay attention to details.i cannot recommend him.,1
"You did well, but I would not recommend that person to do anything like this again. Other than that, it was a good idea and something we might have to try again.",1
As it was somewhat not under workerscotrol based on software although I am sure said worker could of made sure the software was worth using..Horrible terrible work.,1
"Terrible experience with this worker. The person submitted back the work very close to deadline. Not only that, the work was cut off at the end. Would not recommend.",1
"She is incompetent and careless. When doing the work assigned to her, she really need try her best to do a through work. Obviously, she did not meet the expectation.",1
Worker did not check work for quality and submitted incomplete data. There was no communication in regards to the work being incomplete or needing more time to complete.,1
"Avoid this worker; their work ia sporadically incomplete and they submitted their task very close to the deadline, not allowing ample time for suggestion or correction.  ",1
"The worker did submit the work prior to the deadline, however the work was not done or complete to my satisfaction. There were words missing from the translated document.",1
I'm sad to say that I am disappointed with this worker's submission. It does not meet my standards and it seems to have been submitted as incomplete. This is unacceptable.,1
The work I received not only made it to me at the last minute but even worse it came incomplete. I found this totally unacceptable and wouldn't recommend this person at all.,1
This worker submitted the translation very close to the deadline and I am not completely satisfied and somewhat upset with their work. I will give this work to another worker.,1
This worker has a pretty bad work ethic. I got a paper from this one that had cut off the remaining words when I gave them an article to translate. Wouldn't recommend this one.,1
"I am upset about the written review because it made me appear like I'm not competent and made me look bad and I think that is unacceptable, especially since this cost me money.",1
Worker delivered translation very close to deadline and was found to contain inaccuracies that were too late for me to have fixed.  This lack of follow through cost me a client.,1
The worker sux big ones as they do not even pay attention to their work down to the final word. They sux because they have cut corners to the point of creating a bad piece of work.,1
Full effort was exerted in completing the translation. It seems like the job was done at the last minute and it shows. A much better job could have been done if more time was taken.,1
You were available to do the task and on time. The bad thing is that the main part was cut off at the end and there was no way for me to end up catching what mistakes you have made.,1
I am very disappointed in this person's work. I only received partial work for full payment. This resulted in MY reputation being damaged with my client and our contract being limited.,1
The last words were not there at all. I received the report later than I should have received and so it was not satisfactory. I didn't know french so had no idea if it was correct or not.,1
The worker cut off the last word on the page. I do not know French. I handed the translation to someone with the unfinished copy. I would have liked it if the worker had checked the work. ,1
"The worker didn't properly translate the document and provided the translation at the last minute. I would not recommend them to anyone I know, as their mistakes poorly affected me at work.",1
The work was done incomplete resulting in me losing a contract with a client. The work was not done to my expectations and I would not recommend this work per they did not do a thorough job. ,1
This was a very unprofessional use of a translation service. Not only did it cut off the sound of the last sentence it also cut off the last word making me look very dumb in front of my client ,1
This worker was a complete mess. Because of him he made me lose a client because of how bad this translation was. This has literally affected my personal job and I would not suggest him to anyone!,1
"Though the worker was good at adhering to the schedule, the work was subpar.  My client was left dissatisfied.  The work was incomplete.  I personally would not recommend or use this worker again.",1
I think that this person is not fit for this position. The job should of been done in a timely matter. This person jeopardized their client job. The job was done poorly and should not be compensated ,1
"The worker had problems giving me quality work that was based on what appeared to be an error outside of their control. They put in reasonable effort, but did not appear to double check their errors.",1
"I am very disappointed in this work. I don't know if it was human error or something wrong with the program but the work was cut off at the end, resulting in my reputation with my client being damaged.",1
I feel cheated out of my money. This incomplete work caused me great embarrassment with my client. Be very weary of working with this person. I do not have faith in this platform to hire another worker.,1
"The translation was submitted by the deadline date, but was incomplete.  I do not know if this is the worker or systems fault, but it was a huge negative to my job.  I would not use this translator again.",1
The experience that I had was not a good one. The translation was not complete and the work was unsatisfactory.  It resulted in me not having the information I needed for my client and they were not impressed.,1
"Again this worker did not do a very good job. They were very late on their assignment, it was incorrect, and I got a lot of flack. Again I will not work with this in the future no matter what the circumstances.",1
"The worker got everything to me on time, however the quality of the translation did not meet our standards. This may be acceptable for basic translations, but important documents will need to be handled elsewhere",1
The worker translated some text for me but submitted an incomplete cut off translation. Since I did not read the language translated to I did not see this poor work. This poor translation caused me to lose a client.,1
An essay this worker wrote for me was incomplete. I'm not sure if it was an error or intentional but I cannot give a positive recommendation. The work done was important and this person needed to pay more attention.,1
"I was very disappointed that my work was turned in so close to the deadline. On top of that, the worker didn't fully complete the assignment--it was partially cut off when I turned it into a client. Would not recommend.",1
Worker should of followed up with the client about the end result and if the client was happy with the work at the end. Worker should of asked which format of the text client need and prefers to avoid the format issues ,1
This worker seemed to be wholly incompetent because they caused an error on my assignment that caused me to leave a bad impression on a client. I was very dissapointed when i found out such a large error had taken place.,1
The worker did not complete the assignment as agreed and has inferior quality control. She did not translate my full essay: it cut off at the end. My client was dissatisfied and so am I. I would not recommend this worker.,1
I do need you to check your work better from now on before giving it to me.  Your last translation was truncated and it lost me money with a client.  I cannot afford that to happen again.  Please be more careful next time.,1
"I was extremely disappointed by Alice. I think that she did a completely terrible job of translating, and honestly, if she does not know how to translate things, then she probably should not even be employed as a translator.",1
The worker was very bad and took advantage of the fact that I do not know french. I put my trust in them and they betrayed it I would not recommend this worker to anyone who cares about accuracy or any quality in the outcome.,1
"The worker did not do a satisfactory job.  They failed to check their work before sending it to me, and as a result the translation was truncated. They also submitted very close to the deadline, so this could not be corrected. ",1
"I am very unhappy with the work that I received.  I don't believe the translation was correct, and it cost me money.  I find that very unprofessional.  I will not be using your services ever again when it comes to translations. ",1
I would not recommend this person until they improve their skills.  In my opinion did not take the work serious needed to proofread and make sure everything was ok.  Clearly that did not happen and my job suffered because of it.,1
"Even if there was technical problems, she should have made sure the final work was ready and without any error.There is no excuse for the bad quality of her work                                                                   ",1
"She returned incomplete work to me. If you choose this worker, double check the work. I trusted her to do the job, but did not double check her work, as I am not fluent in French. Hopefully she will be more careful in the future. ",1
"While the worker gave the work in by the deadline, he/she did not allow time for proof reading and edits.  Since I was unable to have the worker proofread, there were major errors and work was turned in in an unprofessional state.",1
"I had a very important essay I needed translated for a client before a deadline. I put my faith into this worker, only to find out after handing it in that it was cut off at the end and not even fully completed. Very disappointed.",1
"The worker took licenses and shortcuts in order to complete the work in a short amount of time.  Unfortunately, this was detrimental to the quality of the work. I was not happy with the outcome, and I would not use this worker again.",1
I would not be willing to use this worker again.   This worker pushed much to close to the deadline.     While they made the deadline I would have preferred this worker to be a bit more proactive and not get so close to the deadline. ,1
This worker turned in this work extremely close to the deadline. I didn't realize the work had been cut off and changed how I wanted to come across. This resulted in negative results. I would never use this person again. Not thorough. ,1
"While this worker did a good job of providing me the work by  the deadline, unfortunately it was not up to par and I lost a client due to this. While it could have been due to software issues, I think she should have checked the work. ",1
"The worker is absolutely worthless. He delivers to me an incomplete job which is actually useless for me. He has spoiled my entire hope, commitment and trust. I will not hire him for the second time in future without any second thought.",1
The translator provided me with an unfinished translation.  It turned out to be very costly for my business and I was not informed that the translation was unfinished.  It was very unprofessional and I will not use this translator again.,1
"Worker did not double check their work before giving it to me. There may have been an issue with the software used, but the final product was cut off and changed what I was trying to get across. I wish they would have been more thorough. ",1
I gave the worker an essay to be translated from English to French. She turned in an assignment that was not completed. I feel like she made me look incompetent in my job. She also barely made the deadline. I will not use her services again.,1
"I do not recommend you to work with this person, the translation was not neat, the document I got was incomplete, it was truncated at the end since I speak no french I was relying on this translation and it costed me a very good opportunity.",1
This workers work product was poor and as a result harmed the project and put a strain on a professional relationship with another client.  I would not recommend this worker for further work and absolutely never hire them again for future work.,1
I unfortunately have to say that I was not impressed with this freelancer. They submited the assignment very close to the deadline incomplete. They also caused my other coworkers to be quite upset with me. I will not work with them in the future.,1
"I recruited this worker with the intent of translating my article from English to French. They returned the finished article very close to the deadline, and the ending was missing, as it if was cut off. Not a great worker, will not work with again.",1
"I would not recommend using this translator for anything important that you have. They waited until the last minute to turn in the translated document. If you use them, make sure you ask for it way in advance of what you need the translation done by.",1
"I usually trust workers on this platform but I had a disappointing experience with this translation. Not only was it submitted close to the deadline, it was also not complete which caused me professional problems. I will not be returning to this worker. ",1
"I feel this worker should have more attention to detail with the work that she returns. She returned incomplete work to me, which I did not realize because I am not fluent in French. I hope that in the future that she takes the time to double check her work. ",1
Pushed the work to the deadline rather than being more prompt with it.   The worker knew that I did not speak French at all and the work submitted was not complete and this resulted in a bad impression on myself and my company.   I will not use this worker again. ,1
"Even though the errors in the translation were caused by platform errors and software incompatibilities, the worker should have been aware of those possibilities.  The worker was still responsible for the end product and should have made the necessary corrections.",1
The worker did not perform as well as expected.  I did not receive the report until right before deadline and she missed that some words were cut off.,0
I think this worker try their best and give good result as well because the platform errors and software incompatibilities is not under worker's control.,0
"This person will be great whether its for the sake of the boys or something else, the only thing is that there is hope for this to be completed honestly ",0
I think that some of the translation was not truncated and was respectful and that made me appreciaiative of the work performed and the results received.,0
He seems like avery good worker. He is the type of worker that anyone would want on their team. He seems to take his work seriously and do a good job at it.,0
This worker is one of the best in the business. Everyone makes mistakes. I would not hesitate to hire this worker again in the future for a similar project.,0
This worker can be relied upon to complete assignments before any deadlines. A thorough job can be expected with only errors beyond their control occurring.,0
"I thought the worker did a good job and the work was presented well, it is a shame however that the work was compromised somewhat be a incomplete submission.",0
Worker was respectful and delivered product on time.  There was an issue with the platform software that caused some of the translation work to be truncated.,0
Everything was turned over by the deadline there were errors but wasn't the fault of the worker.  There was a software error.  The worker was always respectful,0
I had submitted work for translation that was unfortunately cut off due to a mistake. I understand sometimes things happen but be sure to have your work checked!,0
It was a small error. But I wish that I had gotten the complete assignment. It cut off the translation at the very end. It might have been some kind of a glitch. ,0
"Take care utilizing this worker, while some work completed by them was quality and all my interactions with them are positive, be sure to double check submitted work.",0
He is working good. But he takes more leaves without intimation. it makes the organization unprofitable. But he is intelligent and a smart worker. He is punctual also.,0
"It may however not be their fault but the fault of the service ruining their work with a computer error. Either way, the worker or the service are bad at what they do.",0
He is punctual and responsible person. He did a jog whole hearted and with responsiblity. He is really well working and well knowledge having person. I really impressed,0
"I would hope that this was a one-time mistake and would not be repeated. Maybe after some time and consideration, I would reconsider giving this worker a second chance.",0
He is really a good working person. He did a job assigned to him within the time I given to him. He did a job without errors. I really impressed by him because of his work,0
I would recommend this worker. They finished the work and completed on time. This worker platform however should not be trusted as the software mutilated the completed work.,0
"Although there was an error with the job, the worker did a good job and the error was not their fault.  I believe they did a very good job and I recommend them for future jobs",0
I had a major system error which caused me to have a problem but the work completed by this individual was satisfactory. I would recommend them if you need something well written.,0
I'm not disappointed with the worker as much as I am in the system. It's unfortunate that the results didn't go through properly and it is no fault of the worker that this occurred.,0
"The worker performed well, they handed report in before deadline and only made  a errors because of software problems not under there control.   They translated everything very well",0
MY WORKER IS VERY EFFECTIVE ANE HE IS DELEVIERED THE PRODUCTS IN TIME WITHOUT LATE AFTER CALLING THE CUSTOMER AND HE IS VERY BRIILLANT AND EASY TO REACH THE PLACE IN CORRECT IN TIME,0
i  am aware there was a glitch in the system that did not allow the worker to completely translate the article but overall the translation was well done. I thank you for your efforts.,0
He is a great workern and would be a great asset to any work team that he can be placed on. He is a great guy. I really enjoy working with this employee and honestly he is always on time,0
He always do his work and completes his work before the due date. I assure that we can do a work within a date by his work. He also makes some decisions that should be useful in deadlines,0
The work was completed and submitted on time. This was a good thing. The worker was respectful of my time and the work being completed. I would recommend using this service in the future.,0
"The portion of the task that was translated, was done so accurately. The worker was not able to finish, but I give them credit for doing the best they can with limitations of the platform.",0
"Worker finished the work within the allotted time, it was well done, and they were very professional in their communications with me. I would consider working with them again in the future.",0
"She is a fairly good worker. Though her work caused some misimpression, something happened was out of her control. It can be acceptable. Suggesting be more careful in the work in the future. ",0
"Worker agreed to translate a English essay to french. There was very little communication on their part until the essay was finished. Work was translated, and sent to me upon the deadline date. ",0
"While it may have been an issue with the platform itself, the end of the text I needed translated was cut off, costing me an important business opportunity.  Would recommend looking at other services.",0
This worked did meet the deadline in the given time and the work I received was good. The biggest I didn't receive the full document. Part of the end got cut off. Not sure what went wrong on their end.,0
"Worker did wonderful job, on time and got my work done! Thanks. I could not say anything wrong with the worker because she did the translation very well and did it on time and on cost. Thank you again. ",0
"Alice did her best, but was unable to properly translate for me. It is unfortunate, but it is not exactly her fault, I think that she did her best. I think that my software was incompatible with theirs.",0
This kind of thing tends to happen from time to time. Nobody is to blame by the shoddy laptop computer that was used for the translation. I wouldn't base my first impression on anything that happened here.,0
I Think they have a good work ethic. a good work ethic is a really important piece of judging workeres because it means that they do have caring attitudes towards what they do and that will lead to success,0
"the worker can do a good job if given maximum time to deliver,he can also work and deliver in time, the worker is respectful and does a good job when you are patient with him. however i believe he can do better.",0
The worker did work on it pretty good but the software or transit system to send me the writing was messed up. I dont know if it was the platform issue or on the workers in. Until it is fixed i cant use this again. ,0
"I was very disappointed to see that my work I needed translated by this translator was truncated at the end. I'm unsure if it was a mistake of the software/platform or an error on their part, but be careful everyone.",0
"This worker done a great job, was very nice, respectful and cooperative. I would use this person again if needed for another report. The report was finished in plenty of time for me so I am very happy with her work. ",0
This worker was very respectful. I received my translated essay from english to french within the correct due date and I'm satisfied with what I was given back. Very respectful and polite person as well. Would recommend.,0
THE WORKER WAS GOOD IN TIME AND HE WAS PERFECT IN WORK AND HE CAN EASILY FIND THE PERSON WHO IS WAITING FOR ACCEPT THE PRODUCTS THE WORKER WAS VERY GOOD AND HIS WAY OF SPEECH IS CLEARLY AND UNDERSTAND AND CORRECT IN TIME.,0
the worker tried her best and I do believe she is a good work and would recomment her to others. She did a good job and did what was required of her and presented it as such so I do believe she should be given a second chance,0
Unfortunately the worker might have suffered from a platform error that caused the worker to not put in the required work. I am not sure if it was all due to a platform error but I would doublecheck next time this person gets some work.,0
"This translator was able to meet my tight deadline and submitted her work in time. Unfortunately, her system malfunctioned and truncated the very end of the translation. Her translation was spot-on, however and she was always respectful.",0
"The translation provided was satisfactory and the worker communicated well.   Overall, I was satisfied by the work they submitted.  However, I did not recieve the entire translation.  This was probably a technical error of the platform. ",0
"The worker was nice and respectful, but the work was turned in too close to the deadline to proof read or have any time to ask questions. If working with this person in the future, make sure to request ample time for a proof reading and question session",0
"As correctly said, human are not responsible for the errors or mistakes committed by the machine. He can not be blamed for his actions. The problem is with the software which was designed to execute the task. So blaming the worker is not at all justifiable.",0
"This worker submitted the translation within the time frame required. Because the work seemed to be truncated due to system errors, I cannot fault this worker for their translation. This person seemed to have done a good job, and had no control over system errors.",0
"Although the worker did fine with the translation, and it was submitted before the deadline they failed to either do or submit the work in its entirety.  This has caused some issues with the client and I donâ€™t feel like they should be punished but pay should be docked. ",0
"The translation I received was great, but there was a issue with the system used that created massive problems for me. It's not the worker's fault, and I received it by my deadline, but maybe next time I'll find an option that doesn't revolve around systems like this one.",0
"The worker seems pretty good, but my issue is that the work was submitted with some information missing. It looked like an honest mistake perhaps but it took away form the quality of the work presented . I would recommend better proofreading of text for future work by this person.",0
"This worker was respectful and friendly during our task.  Generally really pleasant to work with but needs help with their time management.  Since the worker waited until the last possible moment to turn in the project, I was not able to catch the errors made by the system in time.",0
The worker is quite good in his and completed the job within time. Though due to platform errors and software incompatibilities my job of translation was truncated and my job was spoiled. But I believe that it was not the worker's fault and the he had nothing to do with the situation.,0
"The worker translated most of the work very well and they were respectful and polite in their communications. Some technical issues prevented me from getting the full translation, and the worker delivered the product very close to the deadline. I would be hesitant in hiring this worker.",0
The end result of my interaction with this worker didn't work out so well something happened and ended up messing up the result overall the worker was pleasant to deal with but ultimately didn't work out due to a technical hiccup. I would recommend to give them another shot in the future.,0
"The essay I received was translated well.  However, there was a technical problem and the last part of the essay was not translated.  I wish the worker had contacted me about the essay looking odd, or that they had submitted earlier so that there was more of a chance to correct the mistake.",0
"The worker handed in the translation by deadline, on short notice, so that's definitely a positive, but the work I received was cut short. It might have been due to an error in the software, because the work that was translated was done very well, so I would give him benefit of the doubt for now. ",0
"The worker is a fine one, but we had some issues with the last translation piece they did.  It wasnâ€™t completed in its entirely and whether this is fault of the worker or a mechanical error we are unsure at this time.  The translation part that was finished was correct and it was submitted by the deadline. ",0
"Although I received the translated work, it was incomplete. I don't know that this was the worker's fault. It might have been the system's fault, as the work seemed to be truncated. However, my contract was limited as a result of this work, so it is very difficult for me to give a high recommendation for this worker.",0
"This worker did a great job translating my article from English to French, however there was some issues with the system likely removing the end of my article. I do not blame the requester, but only wish they had given me the finished article a little farther from the deadline, where we could have properly fixed the system errors.",0
"The worker is respectful and willing to work with me. Although the deadline was not fully adhered to, I can understand perhaps why an error occurred. This worker did supply quality work, however for reasons unknown, the translation was truncated. This incomplete section did not improve our working relationship and it did cause our reputation to become damaged.",0
"The overall work that has been given to the worker is good, but unfortunately the worker did not finish the document in a correct manner. She took the work to the end of the deadline and submitted the files which seemed to be cut off - she forgot a lot of words that had to be included but were not. I would rethink about hiring this worker again if it were similar tasks.",0
This worker is a really good recruit that has the ability to translate from one language to another. For this case it would be from English to French however this is relaly good because we are getting close to the deadline which would be awful because the translation appeared truncated at the end like as if the system had cut out the remaining words which is really weird.,0
"The translation I received was incomplete and seemed like it had been cut off before it was finished. I can't be sure if it was because of the worker or the computer program, so I don't think I could give a fully accurate assessment at this time. He did have the work completed on time, on short notice, which was impressive, so for now I would give him the benefit of the doubt. ",0
"After your explanation, it has come to my knowledge that its due to the software platform. I would like to know what made error, what are the possibilities and what can be done from our side to remove it. You are supposed to contact the provider of the software, explain the problem happened and get clear answers. We should not repeat the same mistake again. Hope you understand. ",0
"The job you submitted had areas of text missing.  This was not immediately obvious to me, and perhaps it was not apparent to you either.  Please keep in mind that, due to software compatibility, your job may have lost some of the formatting when it was uploaded.  Also, please always feel free to communicate to me any concerns that you have so I can look into it on my end.  Thank you.",0
"My work was submitted in a timely fashion, I did end up having several problems with the translated document. I cannot be sure where the problem lies, but the work was incomplete and it cost me dearly. In regards to communication, I had no problems with this freelancer and was initially excited to work with her. From what I can gather, the part of the work that I did receive in the end was thorough and properly done. ",0
"Unfortunately for me, the translation that I received was incomplete with missing portions. I understand that this is not necessarily the fault of this translator, but I am still very disappointed. As far as I know, the software had a significant error in the way it handled the data to be translated by this worker. That being said, the rest of the translation was very good. Still, I would advise against using this service.",0
"This project was not completed well and caused serious issues and the loss of a client. While the platform errors and software incompatibilities were not directly under their control, stronger communication on their part certainly was. I would hesitate to hire this contractor again for those reasons. The loss of a client is something to be avoided and I feel they could have done a better job with communication to help us avoid this situation. ",0
I cannot give a complete review as I am unaware of any errors that may have occurred in the platform. I do hope the worker tried to contact Upwork if they were experiencing difficulties. They also could have tried to contact me with any troubles. The previous communications with the worker were respectful and I may look into earlier deadlines as to not put workers in a time crunch. I am willing to give this worker another shot and will look into platform errors that may have caused mistakes in this task.,0
"I had an article due for an important client at my job that required this worker's expertise in translation. While the translation seemed fine, the program they used cut off the end of it, therefore butchering the last few words. This reflected very poorly on me, and resulted in the client limiting the contract with the company. This could have been avoided if they would have taken their time and gone over everything. I also received this translation a little too close to the deadline for my liking, but that's on me, too.",0
"Unfortunately there was some problems with the work that was turned in by the translator. I am not fluent in French so I had to assume the work was done correctly. Unfortunately it looks like there was some platform errors and software incompatibilities that lead to the work not being done in a correct manner. The work that was turned in was translated well and it was turned in before the due date. I just wished that I had known about the platform errors and software incompatibilities, so the client wouldn't have been disappointed. ",0
"My worker for this task seemed to do an ok job but I feel that they may have been rushed while working on my task. Either that or they had some sort of computer malfunction or issue. Which is unfortunate because the end of my reports translation was cut off, and seeing as how I am not fluent in french (the reason I outsourced this task in the first place) I did not realize that the end of the report was incomplete or missing. This caused me to look unprofessional and leave a bad impression on a potential client. This error has caused me significant stress and possibly a good amount of money. I wish that I had looked over my workers work more carefully or that the company provided some sort of double check to prevent things like this from happening. Not happy with this service this time. I have had good luck in the past, perhaps I need to select my workers more carefully in the future. ",0
