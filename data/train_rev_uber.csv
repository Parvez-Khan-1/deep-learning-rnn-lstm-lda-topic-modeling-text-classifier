"The driver chose a route with heavy traffic and the subsequent delay increased my fare quite considerably. Due to the delay, I was very late for work.",1
I’m very unhappy with the service and will be immediately unsubscribing soon.  The driver made me very late for my functions and I’d like an incentive.,1
I should be very careful with that driver. He ia a waste person. That driver is not an opt person for driving. I must complaint about him to that office.,1
Car was clean and he was perfectly respectful but the route he took wasn't ideal so I'd guess he isnt familiar with the area and had to rely solely on GPS,1
"Awful. The driver made me 45 minutes late for one of my meetings and I lost my contract because of it. Not only that he charged a huge rate for the ""service.""",1
"The driver was respectful and the car was clean. However, I wish the driver would have looked ahead at the traffic forecast on GPS and taken a different route. ",1
The driver did not know the optimal routes to take and because of this carelessness he made me late for an important meeting bad driver caused a lot of headache!,1
I had a very bad experience. The driver took a high traffic route and I reached 45 minutes late. I am extremely disappointed. This driver must be banned by Uber. ,1
"Regardless of the driver's intentions, the driver showed severe incompetence while driving. This driver essentially ruined my life. This driver deserves punishment.",1
"The driver took a very poor route, causing a 45 minute delay and making me miss an important work meeting. Not the type of service I'm used to when taking rideshare.",1
The ride was subpar. The driver took a route which resulted in me arriving to work 45 minutes late. This is a paid service. I should have received better for my money.,1
"This was a horrible ride. The driver took a long way to my destination making me late for work and missing an important meeting, and the drive ended up costing me more.",1
"I would NOT recommend this driver. He took the longest route in traffic, resulting in me being late to my meeting. On top of that, I had to pay a huge fee for my drive!",1
The driver took a route with a lot of traffic and made me late for work which made me miss a meeting and my boss yelled at me I am ver dissatisfied with the service booo.,1
The driver knew that this route had a lot of traffic but used it anyways. The driver made no attempt to change to a faster route which would have saved me time and money.,1
The bad traffic and high price made me late to work. This resulted in a huge negative impact that I perceive to be the fault of the driver. I wouldn't ride with him again.,1
The ride took so long because the driver took a different route with a heavy traffic. I had to deal with lots of serious consequences because of the driver's route choice.,1
"Although the traffic congestion was not the driver's fault, he did end up charging me a very high price. He could have checked the road conditions in advance, but he didn't. ",1
"Extremely unhappy with the route taken by the driver. It wasn't optimized and as a result not only did we hit massive traffic, I ended up paying much more for the longer ride.",1
the driver took much longer than expected. the driver took a route that had heavy traffic which caused me to miss my appointment and pay extra for the ride. very bad experience.,1
He's routeing method is very poor i feel very upset today only reason for this Trip. He took long minute to drive. If i am went to my by walk i will reach quickly then this Ride,1
This is the absolute worst driver in existence. This driver's errors caused me serious problems both personally and professionally. I am furious and this driver should be banned.,1
They just didnt seem to know what they were doing. They took a long route that took way too long and that lead to me being yelled at and having to pay for all with a lot of money,1
This driver is terrible. He uses the longest route and you end up paying more than you should. I ended up late for work and in trouble with my boss. He should find a different job.,1
"Took the long way, got stuck in traffic. Missed important stuff at work. Would not use. This driver is horrible at his job. I want my money back, had to pay a lot for this crap ride.",1
THE DRIVER WAS UNPOLITE AND USED AN UNUSUAL ROUTE. HE ALSO CHARGED AN ENORMOUS AMOUNT FOR HIS SERVICE. HE SHOULD DEVELOP THESE QUALITIES TO MAINTAIN A BETTER CAREER IN HIS PROFESSION.,1
The car was clean and the driver was also nice but I was still late for my meeting. I think he could have done a better job of driving and paying more attention to the road to be honest,1
The driver should be able to tell which route is clean by his GPS route. He took a route with a heavy traffic which made me to lose important meetings because of the 45 mins traffic delay.,1
The driver was late and charged Alice premium to drive her.  Alice was late to an important meeting.  Alice used the drive app like Uber and was asked to provide a feedback on the driver.  ,1
I would say this driver just simply didn't do a good enough job of helping me with routes and time management. I think this is all easily avoidable with technology that they refused to use.,1
I am very unhappy with my ride service. The driver took a high traffic route and we were delayed 45 minutes. I was late to a business appointment. I doubt I'll use this drive service again.,1
Terrible driver. Could have used GPS or something to find a better route and avoid the traffic. I got in serious trouble at work all from the route that was taken.  Please avoid this driver.,1
"He purposefully chose a longer route. We got stuck in traffic, and the bill was very high. Because of his actions I missed a very important meeting. Would not recommend using his services again. ",1
I am beyond pissed. This driver took a ridiculous route causing a 45min delay and had the nerve to overcharge me on it! I was late for work and obviously my boss was not pleased. Thanks a lot Uber. ,1
The driver chose a bad route that delayed me by about 45 minutes. I would not recommend using this driver. They certainly could have picked a better route so that I would not have been late to work.,1
"I feel that the driver did the best that they could given the circumstances. There is nothing to really sway my review to either side, it was simply a normal trip, yet unfortunately in heavy traffic.",1
The driver simply did not use great reasoning skills. In running into such traffic he could have chosen a different street but he didn't. We sat there stuck as if there was no other way to get around. ,1
The driver took a route that was backed up. As a result I lost a client and got reprimanded by my boss. I wish the driver took a different route but I cannot fully blame the driver for traffic being busy.,1
Uber should have strict rules before accepting new drivers. I had a really terrible experience last time. The driver lacked basic understanding of the route and traffic and I was very late to the meeting. ,1
"Although the driver has no control of the factors above it causes loss to me so I had a bad opinion on the driver,moreover he charged me a higher price which he can reduce on his part but he failed to do so.",1
The cleanliness was not good i don't like the cleanliness but the driving is good and i like it with almost every good liking with the travel the travel experience is good and has good experience in the travel,1
"This is not working out.  The driver was late 45 minutes and made me miss an important meeting. On top of all this, I was charged the premium.  I want my money back and I do not want to use this driver again.  ",1
"Horrible driver, took a poor route, made me late for work. missed a big meeting, boss is super mad at me. This Uber driver has potentially gotten me fired from work. Think twice before getting into this guys car.",1
"The driver took a route that resulted in me being late for work. She should have taken a route that had a lot less traffic, although it is sometimes difficult to predict which routes will be buys at various times.",1
This ride was unacceptable. He took a longer route instead of the quickest. Because of this I missed a major meeting and lost a contract for work. I am furious. Drivers should know the quickest most efficient routes.  ,1
"The driver took a route that resulted in me being late for work.  Even though there was a lot of traffic, she still remained courteous and understanding of my lateness to work. She will try to make it better next time.",1
"I'm extremely unhappy with my driver because he took the way with the most traffic, cost me a lot of money, and made me super late for a meeting and I even got yelled at by my boss. I'm not happy and this driver is just bad. ",1
Unfortunately this driver isn't good at navigating the best routes. I was 45 minutes later than I intended and ended up getting into a lot of trouble at work because of it. Do not recommend this person if you're on a schedule.,1
"This driver was late to pick up and didn't even apologize for it. I ended up being 45 minutes late for work, which could have been prevented if this driver had taken a better route. Overall I would not recommend this driver to anyone!",1
"This was an extremely disappointing and unsatisfactory experience.  The ride cost more than it should have, and the route used was highly sub optimal, causing me to be late for a very important meeting. Would not recommend this driver.",1
"i  am very disspointed by the driver,he used a longer route and i really got late for work because the traffic was very big.i missed my meeting which was very important and my boss was not happy about it.i plan not to use this service again.",1
the experience with the driver was very terrible and it cost me my job. he doesnt know the routes which will be short and time efficient. the journey was suppose to be 10 minutes and he drove me nearly an hour and i lost everything in my job.,1
"Driver was either incompetent or scamming me. They took a very bad route that delayed me by 45 minutes. There was a ton of traffic, and I was late to work, which had extremely bad consequences for me. Will not be using this service ever again.",1
"My driver had some serious issues and I would not recommend. The driver took a terrible route and caused me to be late for an important meeting. After this inconvenience, the fare was extremely high and the driver refused to issue me a refund. ",1
"Driver took me down a poor route that was choked with traffic. I ended up being very late for a very important meeting. On top of that, I got charged a lot more than I should have been because the ride took so long.   I'm very upset about this.",1
"Again i think, the driver might have done best from technical point of view, the delay cause business loss of alice. The driver could offer apology for delay or overcharge by company. Then it could be consider as a one of the forgivable instances.",1
I think the driver should take more charge of being able to help the situation without the technology babysitting him every step of the way. This cost me a lot of time and a chance at a job interview that I have to reschedule because of this driver.,1
"He could have taken a better route. In the end, the commute took a lot longer than it should have and thus cost me a lot more than it should have as well. The car was clean and the driver was kind, but that doesn't make him the most competent driver.",1
My driver caused me to be late for work. It was not a good experience as we got caught in traffic. I also think that the driver could have taken a different route and got me to work on time. I missed an important meeting and it cost me a lot of money.,1
"The review took 45 minutes longer than they should have to get to my destination. Because of that, my contract was cancelled and I am severely impaired at my work because of it. Poor judge of character for this man. I hope he gets it straightened out.",1
this driver did not get me where i needed to go instead he took me the long route and got me stuck in traffic and I missed my most important meeting what an awful driver he should never be allowed to drive again and that's what I have to say about it ,1
this driver did not get me where i needed to go instead he took me the long route and got me stuck in traffic and I missed my most important meeting what an awful driver he should never be allowed to drive again and that's what I have to say about it ,1
"This joker took the worst possible route. I mean THE worst possible, which resulted in me A) being late, B) Losing a client, C) being charged a ridiculous price because the driver can't read Google maps and, D) my day being ruined. Worst Uber driver ever.  ",1
"The driver is unprofessional,took a longer distance.He is disrespectful towards the customers and took almost 45 mins late to my destination by taking a route which is full  with traffic.Moreover they charge a high price on the ride.I never recommend this driver.",1
"Overall, I am very dissatisfied with the ride I received. The driver took a bad route with a ton of traffic which resulted in a very long delay, causing me to be late to work. It also caused the price of the ride to be excessively high. I would avoid this driver in the future.",1
"My driver was terrible. He was definitely not familiar with the route, or he just wanted to overcharge me. The commute took forever because of his choices. I was late for work because of this driver. I hope he loses his job because he is an idiot. He cost my company and I a lot today. ",1
"It was very important that I get to work on time for an important meeting. The driver was courteous, but took a route that was crowded with traffic.  They didn't try to find an alternate route.  I ended up paying a super high fee for the drive and was 45 mins late.  Totally unacceptable.",1
"It was very important that I get to work on time for an important meeting. The driver was courteous, but took a route that was crowded with traffic.  They didn't try to find an alternate route.  I ended up paying a super high fee for the drive and was 45 mins late.  Totally unacceptable.",1
"The driver took a route which was completely jammed with traffic. This was not the route I expected and I was completely frustrated. This route took much longer, making me late. The driver had the nerve to charge me way more than I expected to pay, I would not ride with this driver again.",1
"As someone who drives for a living, this driver should have know the best routes for this time. Instead they ignored this. Taking a path with a lot of traffic, causing me to be late 45 minutes, miss a meeting and get overcharged. I believe they did this simply so they could charge me more.",1
My own driver is such a good person. He will always drive safely. He will not talk much during driving. He will follow and obey all the traffic rules. ,0
Dissappointed with my ride. Wish the driver tried harder to get me to work on time. Really hope to not experience this type of ride again in the future. ,0
"The car was clean and the driver was nice, but i was still late for work and that isn't acceptable to me. This is more of an issue with the service itself. ",0
the driver was polite and the car was good. the route was all messed up and i don't know whose fault it was. it wasn't mine. i rated neutral because of this.,0
"The driver was courteous, and could tell I was concerned about the length of the trip and how long it was taking. They tried to make the trip a pleasant one.",0
"The driver was courteous, and could tell I was concerned about the length of the trip and how long it was taking. They tried to make the trip a pleasant one.",0
Very disappointed with my ride. I was very late to work which resulted in very bad consequences. Hope to not have an experience like this again in the future.,0
Took too long and route was filled with traffic. Very frustrating and the price of the trip was a lot more than I expected for the ride. I wouldn't recommend.,0
This driver was professional enough. The car was nice and they were polite. I guess there were some factors outside of their control but they handled it well.,0
"Uber assigned the driver a route with heavy traffic and the subsequent delay increased my fare quite considerably. Due to the delay, I was very late for work.",0
Not very happy but probably not the fault of her but of the company.  I was late and was charged a bunch but Stuff happens and she was not the one charginig met. ,0
"there was unexpected traffic and the drive took much longer than expected. however, the car and driver was pleasant excluding the unforeseen issues we encountered.",0
Driver and his car were very nice i'm unhappy with the price of the ride and route taken. this is ubers fault not the driver! You suck i want a refund!! seriously!!,0
Driver was friendly and courteous during the ride. It took 45 minutes to get to where I was going causing me to lose a contract but that can't be totally blamed on him. ,0
The driver kept a clean car and was very nice to me during the ride. He was nice to talk to. I appreciated this kind of service. I would definitely recommend this driver. ,0
Tough time but not drivers fault.  We had some traffic issues and the rates were out of this world but I konw that is not my uber drivers fual just the fault of the system. ,0
the driver is make their travel very safety and clean their car very perfect and the check back all the parts of the vehicle.  It is very necessary to the driver's profession,0
The car was clean and I understand that the driver was respectful  I was late for work because of traffic so I missed an important meeting and the ride cost me a lot of money.,0
"The ride was average. I did not get there in time. But, it was no fault of my driver. I am still disappointed by the service.                                                   ",0
The driver was respectful during the ride and the vehicle was clean inside. Given my understanding of what is or isn't in the driver's control I'd say this driver did a good job.,0
 I must add that the driver was very respectful and nice. I noticed that the car was clean and there was no trash laying around. I can also acknowledge the GPS routes aren’t perfect.,0
I had no issues with the driver.  He was just fine and did his job.  I got there late but that was the traffic to blame.  He had no control over it.  I got to where I needed to go.  ,0
I had a long ride with this driver. There was a lot of traffic and delays. The driver however was polite and the car was clean. I had no problems with the driver's manners or the car.,0
"I don't know if it's the driver's or Uber's fault, but a route was selected with extremely high traffic. The trip took longer than it should and led to very serious consequences for me.",0
the ride was taken for too long time and the driver guided with the gps doesnt have any alternative routes to avoid the traffics. though he was polite and the car was in good condition.,0
The route they took could have been better. It led to me being late and having to pay a high price for all of that as well. I was then yelled at when I got to work because of all of this. ,0
Good Driver but today is my worst day of my life. But he also make some mistake one little street they take right if he take left on the i soonly reach my office. but any way driving is good,0
The driver was very friendly and respectful during the whole ride. There was nothing the driver could have really done and i guess it was just all due to bad luck that we were stuck in traffic.,0
The drive to work was fine except for the fact that I was stuck in traffic for 45 minutes which caused me to be late. The driver was nice and it's not his fault that the gps took us on that route.,0
"The car was clean and the driver was polite.  I think he followed the standard route to my destination. But traffic was very heavy on our route, took much longer than usual,  I wish he had warned me.",0
I am satisfied with my drive service. While the traffic was bad and we arrived to our destination 45 minutes late. The car was clean and the driver was respectful throughout the duration of the ride. ,0
The driver was nice and respectful during the car ride. I also appreciated the fact that the vehicle was clean. It is hard to overlook that they chose a route that was so backed up and I was quite late.,0
"No. Screw you. You aren't paying me enough to write essays for you, you cheap creep. Go fuck yourself. No. Screw you. You aren't paying me enough to write essays for you, you cheap creep. Go fuck yourself.",0
I was very unhappy with the overall service. I ended up 40 minutes late to my appointment and I am not thrilled.  I was billed more than I should have been because the ride took longer than it should have.,0
"While the car was clean and he was respectful, my ride wasn't very pleasant as I was considerably late to my destination. The company should improve their GPS routes to manage traffic better for customers.",0
"even though the driver was nice and the car was clean,i eventually was late for work by around 45 minutes.i was angry because i missed a lot at work,a very important meeting and i suffered a loss from this.",0
"This ride was awful. Its not the drivers fault, but the route he had to take was slow and made me late. I missed stuff at work and had to pay a lot for the ride. This company needs to get its act together. ",0
"The car was clean and the driver was very courteous and respectful, but they took a very poor route that ended up with us in a 45 minute traffic delay. Out of the drivers control, but poor routing nonetheless.",0
I didn't think this was a fair exchange of good for my money. The good being a ride service that would get me where I needed to go on time! I wasn't on time it was too expensive and I'm extremely dissappointed!,0
"one who is doing his driving work perfect they call as a perfect driver.  he is control the vehicle and drive properly in the way of their driving, go safe for their journey and get back to the passenger safely.",0
"Overall the ride was satisfactory. While I arrived late and the price of the ride was very high, the driver cannot control these factors. That said, the car was clean and the other aspects of the service were good.",0
My driver was friendly and the car I rode in was clean. I ended up being late for work through no fault of the driver. I was charged what I believe is a high amount for the ride. All in all the driver is acceptable.,0
"THis app had my driver taking the longest route possible for what I can only assume was to be able to charge me a higher fee. The driver was awesome and the car was fresh and clean, but the company lacks any ethics.",0
"The actual driver was fine, and the car was clean, and he got me to my destination, but the route was longer than usual, and traffic was very heavy, resulting in me being very late for work and missing an important meeting.",0
"The ride sucked. We had to go through the very busy street which ate up almost 45 minutes. It wasn't his fault though the GPS gave bad directions and he didn't' know the street would be so busy. He was nice, the ride was not.",0
"The driver was fine. The car was clean and he was respectful. However, the system is bad, designed to get as much money as possible by taking terrible routes, getting you into traffic, etc. I won't be using this service again.",0
"I can't really blame the situation 100% on this driver, however I feel that some things could have been changed. We got stuck in traffic for 45 minutes. As a driver, you should anticipate traffic loads and find alternate routes. ",0
"The route went through a high traffic area and took way too long for what it should have. the fee was way too high and i was late to work. whether this was poor planning, coincidence or on purpose i don't know so i rated neutral.",0
"I had an unfortunate driving experience due to traffic and what I was charged, but these were beyond the driver's abilities to impact. On a positive note, he had a cleanly care that was pleasant to ride in, and he was a kind man.",0
"EVEN THOUGH THE TRAFFIC WAS VERY PEAK, THE DRIVER WAS VERY POLITE AND DO NOT RUSH OVER THE ROUTES. HE ALSO MAINTAIN HIS VEHICLE VERY GOOD. HE MAY KNOW SOME OF THE ALTERNATE ROUTES TO DROP EARLIER. IT COULD IMPROVE HIS PROFESSION.",0
The driver was nice. The rout took some time to get to result in negative consequences for me. I do not blame the driver for the heavy traffic. The car was clean and comfortable. I wish they had options to take alternative routes.,0
"The driver was okay, but due to the traffic and route, I arrived late to my destination and had to pay a huge fare. The driver was respectful and the car clean. I wish he could have taken a different route to avoid traffic though.",0
"The driver was nice and the car was clean. The route was a poor choice however. This led to serious problems with my job. While this is not the driver's direct fault, Uber should rectify their GPS to choose routes with less traffic.",0
"The traffic and GPS route is not the controllable thing that the driver can do, but he would have chosen a less traffic route to make the customers reach on time .Since the driver was respectful I had to forgo about the other issues.",0
The driver was very nice and very respectful. I was completely frustrated with the whole uber ride but I have to say the driver kept me calm and reassured me that everything would be fine. The car was clean and this driver was so nice.,0
"I am extremely frustrated with the lack of routes with this service. A poor route landed us in traffic, causing a lot of issues for me. But even more so, I feel overcharged. The driver, however, was kind and respectful and drove a clean car. ",0
"I'm very displeased with the service provided by this driver. They chose a route that took forever, cost me a lot of money, and delivered me to my destination very late. I think they did it deliberately, and maybe you shouldn't use them in the future.",0
"The high price that was charged was not fair. The ride took a lot longer then normal and I was still charged a high price. I know that the traffic wasn't the driver's fault, but there should be a price adjustment if the ride takes longer then average.",0
"The GPS route was wrong, the traffic was surprisingly brutal, and the rates are something that my driver couldn't control. That all being said, I think the driver could have kept me more updated so it could be possible to coordinate with my work sooner.",0
"We got stuck in some traffic, but I understand the driver does not control that. Perhaps the company should rethink its pricing rates if they go up while the customer suffers in traffic. Other than that the ride was fine and I don't have much to report.",0
The driver is good and the driving is good the speed limit he maintained the speed limit what expected and got a high and good manners he has but the price range is good and makes a quality diving experience in the travel at all i like the driving experience in the travel,0
"This driver did their best to pick me up on time, but there was considerable traffic which prevented that from happening. This being outside of the drivers control, I don't fault them for it. Besides that, the ride was good. The driver did the best they could with the circumstances.",0
"So my Uber ride did not go as planned.  There was a ton of traffic and it was really expensive.  At least my driver was courteous and the car was clean.  I guess it could have been worse.  I'll need to allow more time for traffic in the future when I have an important meeting, I guess.",0
"There were very difficult and trying circumstances during this particular ride that caused me to be late. I do not think it was all the driver's fault, but they would probably not be my first choice in the future, as they were not totally able to overcome these problems despite their efforts.",0
"The driver was fine, I'm super upset at Uber itself. Sent the driver on a bad route, causing me to be super late for work. My boss is pissed at me and I'm concerned I might lose my job because of something out of my drivers control. Think twice about using Uber when you need to be somewhere in a timely manner.",0
"Though the ride cost more than I was expecting and the GPS route caused me to be late to work, I have to say that the driver was really nice. He was so respectful and the car itself was clean. He was a good driver who got me there in safe condition. All in all, I was impressed with him regardless of the other factors.",0
I wasn't happy with the price because the traffic was bad which made me late and get into trouble with my job.  The price wasn't worth all that plus being late.  The driver had nothing to do with the traffic so he wasn't to blame but he picked the route that had a lot of traffic.  I just felt that I shouldn't have been charged so much. ,0
"The driver's car was clean and reasonably comfortable.  Unfortunately, I was so upset about being late that I really didn't pay too much attention to other aspects of the ride.  The driver was apologetic, but it didn't seem all that sincere.  While I know there were many things out of his control, I still wouldn't want to ride with him again.",0
"I'd like to think that this was not entirely the drivers fault, and I am trying to maintain my patience here, but this really makes me want to stop using this ride sharing service.  I don't know if I will be able to have faith in this kind of service again after my experience with getting to work so late today.  Hopefully next time the ride is exceptionally good.",0
"I recently took a ride with this driver, and I was pretty unsatisfied with my experience overall, though I will admit that some of it wasn't his fault. He took a route that went through heavy traffic, causing me to be late to work and lose an important client. The price I paid was also hefty, despite the unnecessarily long ride duration. Overall, I feel bad about the experience, though I realize some of it wasn't up to the driver.",0
